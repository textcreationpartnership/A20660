            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I TOLDE yow M.

               <p>I conclude therefore; that theſe places are by M. Dorman fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely, <note place="margin">Nowell.

Which is I ſaie to rebell againſt their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, to contemne their ſuperiours and laufull gouernours. Nowe as youre ſelfe woulde not I trowe ſaie, that if anie of yow ſhoulde by writing or anie other vnlaufull meanes (which god forbid) go about to ſtirre vpp the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt oure laufull Quene, he ſhoulde ſpeake impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the purpoſe, that to diſſwade them therefro, ſhoulde begin his purpoſed talcke after this manner: Remembre

Eſpecially ſeing that I preſuppoſed and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes proued in the diſcourſe of that article, that the B. of Romes auctoritie was no leſſe ouer the whole churche in ſpirituall matters, then is that of other princes ouer their ſeuerall kingdomes in temporall iuriſdiction. The which pointe (if yow had done ordrely) yow ought firſt to haue confuted, that ſo iuſtlie after ſuche diſproufe yow might haue reproued the applieng of theſe auctorities.</p>
               <p>There is no mention made in anie of theſe places of the B. of Cauntorbury, ne yeat of London neither, all though youre ſelfe graunte that by theſe places yt is proued, that euery inferiour ought to be obedient to his owne biſhop as <note place="margin">Fol. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon what letted me in my preface, to applie aſwell theſe places to the diſobeing of the B. of Rome, allthough he be not there named, as for yow when the caſe ſhall ſo requier, to applie them to the biſhoppes of Cauntorbury or London, no more there then the pope mentioned by name.

               <p>Onely this is moſte euident in what ſenſe ſo euer S.

Whereof ſeing youre ſelfe are not ignorant, you haue delt not ſimply but doubly, labouring to decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue the ſimple, by defacing (as you thougth) my preface as vnſkilfully written, for that I haue there only ſayde and not proued, that the pope is the chiefe heade of Chriſtes churche in earthe, whereas that I referred (as by good ordre of writing the learned knowe I ought) to the firſt article of the popes ſupremacie. To the reaſons and proufes in which place brought, as in all youre anſwere you neuer come neare, but cauill and wrangle againſt my Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whiche ſhoweth the cauſe of ſchiſmes to be diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience againſt paſtours and biſhops: ſo if they be applied to this place as they muſt, then ſhall it appeare how falſely

               <p>But becauſe the whole force of this firſt anſwere of you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res to proue my argument naught ſtandeth in this, that the biſhop of Rome being a forriner, no ſuche reaſon can be made from S.

Cyprian if he had taken the B. of Rome to be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner in other countries, woulde haue euer willed him to haue ſent ſuche lettres, as whereby he ſhoulde exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, and depriue of his biſhoprike a ſtubborne or wilful here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, when with as good right as M Nowell dother here, the heretike biſhop might haue bidden him go ſhake his eares foreine vſurper as he was, and meddle in his owne dioceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe with excommunicating, depriuing and placing of his owne ſubiectes, and let Arles in Fraunce where he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe, alone. Conſidre whether theſe wordes <hi>(and the flocke of Chriſte ſcattred &amp;c. maye be gathered together,</hi> doe not argue as muche, as that when peculier paſtours doe not their duties, recourſe ought to be had to the biſhop of Rome the heade and chiefe ſhepherd of all? Finally Let M. Nowell conſidre, whether he would him ſelfe (hauing that opinion that the B. of Orleance for example, in Fraunce, were as he is, a forriner in England) write vnto him, to ſende his lettres to the citie and people of London to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, and depriue M. Grindal becauſe he is an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike. If he woulde not (as that is to be iudged) trulie he ſhoulde doe <hi>S.</hi> Cyprian wrong to make men beleue that he woulde playe ſuche a fooliſhe parte as he woulde not him ſelfe. It foloweth therfore, that in Fraunce by the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of S. Cyprian the B. off Rome was taken for no foriner. <note place="margin">Spaine.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Of Spaine, whether there the B. of Rome were a fori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, let the reſtoring of Baſilides by Stephanus the Pope to his biſhoprike, be a witneſſe. Againſt which ſentence when S. Cyprian with the other biſhoppes of Africa gathered to gather defendid <hi>Sabinus</hi> the newe made biſhop, they had
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17023:16"/> no other thing to obiect, but that <hi>Baſilides</hi> the heretike had <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cyprian Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4.</note> deceiued Steuin the biſhop of Rome, <hi>longè poſitum, &amp; rei ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtae, ac veritatis ignarum,</hi> dwelling far of, and being ignorant of the caſe and truthe, by wrong information. If Steuin the Pope had bene taken by S. Cyprian to be a forriner in Spaine, woulde he not rather haue taken againſt his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that peremptory exception, then haue vſed that which confirmeth his auctoritie in Spaine? For ſeing the ſentence was vniuſt for no other cauſe, but becauſe the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion was vntrue, it foloweth that if it had bene true the ſentence had bene good, and the iudge not forreine but laufull. Otherwiſe ſhoulde S. Cyprian neuer haue ſaide: <hi>Neque enim tam culpandus eſt ille cui neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter obreptu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quám hic execrandus qui fraudulenter obrepſit.</hi> For he is not ſo muche to be blamed that was ſtollen vpon by negligence, as he is to be abhorred that guilefully did ſteale vpon him. But he ſhoulde contrary wiſe haue ſaide rather: He is not ſo much to be blamed, that to helpe his own matter tolde a falſe tale, as he is to be abhorred, that would preſume being a forriner, to meddle in ſtrange countries where he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe. But S.

               <p>I neuer ſaide that Nouatus exacted an othe againſt the <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> popes ſupremacie. I ſaide, and do ſtill, that he exacted an vnlaufull othe againſt Cornelius then Pope, and in that reſpecte the heade and gouernour of Chriſtes church. The likenes of the othe wherein I matched yow, was, that bothe that othe which Nouatus offred, and this which yow ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre, tende to one ende, to trouble the beautifull ordre of Chriſtes churche, and to withdrawe men from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of their laufull paſtour. For as laufully is the B. of Rome in ſpirituall matters oure heade, as he was heade to Nouatus. So that what ſo euer yow ſaie here of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie betwene Cornelius and Nouatus for the biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike of Rome, what ſo euer yow imagine of the laufulneſſe of youre othes, being as yow ſaye of obedience to youre naturall prince and oures, and of the iniquitie of Nouatus othe being againſt his laufull biſhop, all is to no purpoſe.

               <p>Yow ſaye that as Nouatus required an othe of his folowers &amp;c: <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 7. a. 7.</note> So did the profeſſours of the ſame hereſies trauell in Afrike with their diſciples there being Africanes, that they ſhoulde not returne to Cyprian B. of Carthage to communicate with him, which as it maketh nothing for any ſupremacie of S.

               <p>As for youre bragging how yow folow the vſage of the primitiue churche, by giuing the ſacrament into their han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des who receiue it: I aſke yow this queſtion, grounding the <note place="margin">

Why cauſe yow not yong babes to communicate againe as once they did in the primitiue churche, and then make youre bragges thereof to, that yow kepe the vſage of the primitiue churche?</p>
               <p>Now that yow haue diſcourſed learnedly as yow thinke <note place="margin">Fo. 9. a. 3.</note> vpon the place of <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> with charging me off min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling impertinent thinges by the waye &amp;c. Whereas he that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th but halfe an eye maye ſee, that without I woulde haue out of halfe the ſentence I coulde doe no otherwiſe then I did. Which if I had, yow woulde not belike neither haue taken in verie good parte, ſeing that euen for that which as not perteining to the matter I omitted, yow reprehende me, cauilling that I haue paſſed ouer in ſilence that which is againſt me:</p>
               <p>Yow returne (yow ſaie) to the purpoſe againe, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credite <note place="margin">Nowell. a. 17.</note> me for euer, yow couche together a nombre of eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent lies which yow affirme, no leſſe then in one halfe leafe ſiue on a cluſtre, to haue bene made by me.</p>
               <p>Well ſeing then nowe we be come to that pointe, let vs <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> two counte together that by euen reconing we maye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long friendes, and ſee who is in others debt. Nowe ſaye on M. Nowell, which is the firſt of theſe fiue lyes?</p>
               <p>The firſt lie is, that after his diſcourſe out of S. Cyprian of the <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> biſhop appointed by God to be the gouernour and heade of the churche, he ſaieth the B. of Rome is that heade, whereas by S. Cyprian the contrarie is euident: and that him ſelfe, or B. Roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian is that heade whereof he ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p>They are two thinges to ſaye, that the B. of Rome is the heade appointed by God to gouerne the churche, and <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> that in the places alleaged out of S. Cyprian for an other purpoſe, S. Cyprian ment ſo. I ſaide I graunte that the B.
<pb facs="tcp:17023:23"/> of Rome is the heade appointed by god to gouerne the churche: proue yow the contrarye then ſaye I haue lied. That S. Cyprian in the places by me alleaged was of that minde, that ſaide I neuer: as by the place whither I referre my ſelfe I offer to be tried. So that of this I am cleered, and the lye returneth to yow for belying me, not alone but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an other in that yow ſaie, that by S. Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <note place="margin">A double lye. 8. 9.</note> the contrarie is euident, that is to ſaie, that the B. of Rome is not heade of the churche, and ſo is this on youre parte a pregnant lye.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde is, that to make warre againſt the B. of Rome, is the firſt entrie in to hereſie. Whereas S. Cyprian teacheth that the <note place="margin">Nowell. a. 24.</note> contempt of euery godly Biſhop in his owne dioceſſe by ſuche as are their inferiours is the beginning of hereſies.</p>
               <p>If yow meane that directly I vſed as for a proufe S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> to proue that to make warre againſt the B. of Rome is the firſt entrye to hereſie, that I denie: and ſo yow belye me therein. If yow meane that becauſe I concluded ſo mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che by the waye of introduction that therefore I lyed, then yow haue made youre ſelfe a lye that waies. For the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holdeth and is verye good: <hi>The beginning and entrie into hereſies is to rebell againſt the heade.</hi> ergo <hi>a fortiori, to rebell againſt the chiefe heade of all other, by S. Cyprian muſt nedes be the beginning of ſchiſmes and hereſies.</hi> And ſo this ſtandeth for an other lye. <note place="margin">A lye. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The. 3. lye that yow laye to me is, becauſe I ſaie that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatus made his firſt entrie in to his hereſies by making open warre againſt the B. of Rome &amp;c. Which yow call a double lye, becauſe firſt Nouatus began his hereſies by youre opinion in Afrike: next, becauſe I ſaie that Nouatus made warre againſt Cornelius as the gouernour and heade of the churche. For yow ſaye my wordes, Thus did Noua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17023:23"/> muſt nedes be referred to that which went before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>To the firſt parte of this forcked lye I anſwered before, in prouing that whereſoeuer heretikes begin, they aſſault the heade of the churche: and therefore to ſaye the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary becauſe Nouatus ſhoulde begin his hereſies firſt in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike, is a lye on youre behalfe. As is alſo the ſeconde parte, when yow charge me to haue ſaide that Nouatus ſtriued againſt the pope as heade of the church, thinking to proue the ſame by referring my wordes, <hi>Thus did Nouatus,</hi> to tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe that went before: which if yow doe, yow ſhall proue therby naught elles, but that he made warre againſt the beautifull ordre of the churche, and the biſhop of Rome by god appointed to be the heade thereof. <note n="*" place="margin">Not all one, to ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the heade of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, and to ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him as heade of the churche two Lies 11. 12.</note> For thoſe are the wordes that go before. And ſo haue yow made here two lyes.</p>
               <p>The fourth lye that yow burden we withall, is a very ſclaunderouſe and moſte peuiſh lye, without al reaſon wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and wrong by force out of my wordes to make vp a nombre. As firſt that I ſaye the receiuing of the bleſſed ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the altar in ſtede of the diſtribution of the bread, that you count one lye, becauſe Nicephorus you ſaye <note place="margin">b. 25. 26.</note> hath no ſuche wordes. <hi>Nicephorus</hi> hath not I confeſſe the ſame wordes, nor I euer ſaied he had, nor promiſed to allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge the verie ſame, but was contented to vſe a worde ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieng aſmoche and better knowen to all men then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore as long as I kept the ſenſe of the auctor as you can not denie but I did, I lyed not: Ergo, yow lyed The other ſurmiſed lye is, becauſe I ſaye, they that minded to receiue it etc. And why is this a lye M. Nowell? Yow anſwere: becauſe they had receiued it allready in to their handes. Yea but I tell you againe M. Nowell that they came not thither as muche as yow triumphe of receiuing in to their
<pb facs="tcp:17023:24"/> handes, to receiue it onely in to their handes, but eſpecially to receiue it into their bodies: and therefore yow ſhould to proue me herein a lier haue concluded, that they coulde not be ſaid minded to receiue, as they who had receiued all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready bothe into their handes and bodies. And of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall <note place="margin">M. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well a wrangler.</note> receiuing ſeing yow coulde not be ignorant that I ment, yow haue not onelie proued youre ſelfe a lier, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared alſo to the worlde that yow conforme not youre ſelfe in writing to that ſpirit that becommeth a diuine, but to ſuch wrangling and quarelling where no cauſe is, as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye common ſkoldes would be aſhamed to vſe.</p>
               <p>The 5. lye is, that I affirme, (you ſaye) that yow ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 10. a. 1.</note> men in ſuche ſorte as Nouatus did. And here yow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate againe, that the othe exacted by Nouatus was vnlaufull, becauſe he exacted an othe of the Romaines to cleaue to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their owne biſhop: you require an othe of ſubiectes Engliſh men, of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to their and oure natural prince, and of renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all foraine and vſurped power. Again, Nouatus cauſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſweare that his hereſie was the truth, and that Cornelius true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was hereſie: yow haue no ſuche matters in hande but are on Cornelius ſide againſt Nouatus &amp;c. Vpon theſe two differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces yowe conclude, that loke how often I ſaie, ſo did Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo did Caluin, So doo thoſe wicked men in oure country: &amp;c as ofte as I ſaie. They exacted this othe &amp;c. If he giue not this othe &amp;c. ſo many lowde and lewde lyes I haue made.</p>
               <p>Vntill yow be hable to proue M. Nowell, that the B. of Rome is not oure laufull biſhop that be Engliſh men, <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> that his power is fortaine and vſurped, euen in this pointe ſhall yow agree with Nouatus, that you ſweare men againſt their laufull biſhop as he did. Yow maye not thinke youre ſelfe ſufficiently diſcharged becauſe yow ſaie his power is vſurped, for that colour Nouatus alſo I warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t yow gaue to his wicked doinges. As for the hereſie of Nouatus although youre othe tende not ſpecially to the maintenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17023:24"/> yeat maketh it directly for the maintenaunce of diuerſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more abhominable. But yow contrarie to all good le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arning, as though yow wrote only to deceiue the ſimple not paſsing for the iudgement of the learned, thinke youre ſelues marueilouſly well diſcharged, if the compariſon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de betwene yow and Nouatus agree not iuſtly in euery ſmall point. Thus you ſee for 5. lyes which in theſe feweli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes yow ſclaundre me to haue made, whereas I haue nowe cleered my ſelfe of them al fiue, it foloweth that as often as yow ſaie that I lye, ſo often times, that is to ſaye fiue, yow haue lied youre ſelfe, and thriſe more beſide, as in the count betwene vs it appeareth. So that nowe that I haue anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you for ſuche matter as from the beginning yow coulde charge me withall, yow muſt not thinke me to dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le hardely with yow, if I call yow alſo to account of ſuche manifeſt and inexcuſable lyes, as hetherto in theſe fewe leaues of youres yow haue made. Wherein I ſhall deſire the (gentle reader) to ſhewe thy ſelfe a good and vpright audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor betwene vs.</p>
               <p>Firſt yow ſaye M. Nowell, that the ſentence of S Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten <note place="margin">In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his boke.</note> prefixed by me before my booke, maketh directly againſt the papiſtes, as yow terme vs. That is an euident lie as hathe bene declared.</p>
               <p>Item, that you promiſed to leaue no ſaying of anie olde doctour vnanſwered, alleaged by me. Which ſeing you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue not perfourmed in that which being brought out off S. Auſten was of all other the firſt, but haue paſſed ouer in ſilence theſe wordes. <hi>Thow doeſt not communicate with all nations,</hi> wherein the force of the place conſiſted, this is the ſeconde lye.</p>
               <p>Item that Cyprian declareth in deede in the 9. epiſtle of the fourth boke, that the biſhoppes of all places be of equall <note place="margin">

                  <pb facs="tcp:17023:25"/> auctoritie, it is an other lye grounded falſely vpon S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian.</p>
               <p>Item, that I falſefied S. Baſile his wordes (of the which I <note place="margin">
                     <hi>fol.</hi> 5. <hi>b.</hi> 22.</note> made no mention) it is a ſclaunderouſe lye.</p>
               <p>Item, that Nouatus began his hereſie firſt in Afrike, it is a lye falſelie fathered vpon S. Cyprian, who mencioneth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>fol.</hi> 7. <hi>a.</hi> 24 <hi>Li.</hi> 2. <hi>epi.</hi> 8.</note> his ſchiſme, not his hereſy, which all writers agree that he fell firſt into at Rome, vpon diſpleaſure conceiued of the repulſe that he ſuffred in ſtanding for the biſhopricke off Rome.</p>
               <p>Item, that the profeſſours of Nouatus hereſies trauailed in Afrike againſt S. Cyprian as Nouatus him ſelfe did in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Epist.</hi> 9.</note> Italie againſt Cornelius the B. of Rome, it is affirmed by yow M. Nowell to be proued by S. Cyprian, but the place <note place="margin">
                     <hi>fol.</hi> 7. <hi>a.</hi> 7.</note> hauing bene examined hathe no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>Item, whereas Nicephorus hath: <hi>Cum oblationes offerret</hi>

               <p>You finde faulte with vntrue coating of the places allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17023:25"/> which although to all writers it be a thing that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happeneth, and to none ſo common <note n="*" place="margin">I referre me to your Apologie.</note> as to thoſe of youre occupation: yeat in me ſo maliciouſe a man I am, it muſt nedes be of ſett purpoſe that ſuche as woulde be deſirou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe to ſee the originalls might not to ſpedely finde oute the lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneſſe <note place="margin">Nowel 26.</note> of my allegations, ſeruing nothing to the purpoſe, vnleſſe perhappes (yow ſaie) I did neuer vſe mine owne eyes in vewing of thoſe places.</p>
               <p>Well M. Nowell I praye you yeat ſtande good maiſter <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> vnto me, or at the leaſt fauour your ſelfe. For I thinke for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie greate faultes that be yeat committed, yow are ronne as far into the laſhe as I, although in the ſpace of one leafe <note place="margin">b. 4.</note> or little more, yow ſaye that of fower onely places alleaged, thre thereof be noted vntruly.

For whereas I alleaged the firſt ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of S.

The ſecond errour in printing the 30. chapitre of Nicephorus for the thirde, was committed by this meanes. I wrote in my copie, cap. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. as yow ſee here. The compoſer of the letters vnacquainted with this kinde of writing, miſtaking the o aboue for a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure that ſhould ſtande beneathe placed it ſo, and made of thre, thirty.</p>

               <head>Of the place of S. Baſile epiſt. 70. that it was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye applied to the heretikes of ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re time &amp; cae. The. 5. Chapter.</head>
               <p>M. Nowell woulde induce the reader to thinke, that this place of S. Baſile ſhoulde be brought by me to perſuade that he and his companions were Arrians. And therfore purging him ſelf and his mates of this crime, he concludeth thus.</p>
               <p>Wherfore his ſainges in that Epiſtle apperteine nothing to <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 12. b. 18</note> vs, who are nothing guiltie of thoſe crimes and hereſies, but they are brought in by dreaming M. Dorman without anie cauſe and beſide all purpoſe.</p>
               <p>What nede this affected ignorance M. Nowell? Yow <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> knowe well inough that I neuer charged you with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian hereſie. But thus it pleaſeth yow to handle me, as though yow might by this meanes bringe me in to an euill conceite with the reader, by perſuading that I alleage no place to the purpoſe. The Arrians yow wote well (for it is a thing incident to hereſies) had beſide their errours in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine manie foule deformities in maners. Now what a newe kinde of reaſon is this I praie yow that yow vſe: I am not like Dauus or Syrus in one or two properties that they haue: Ergo in no propertie at all. Doe you agree with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians in no pointe of their maners, becauſe yow beleue (you ſaye) well concerning the doctrine of the Trinitie? If you beleue well, God continue you therein, at the leaſt ſome of your pewe felowes prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding once as good affection therto as you do nowe, haue come ſo farre, that they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue blaſphemed it in open ſermons, but prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted <note place="margin">See Staphy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lus in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhe. fol. 113. a.</note> alſo to be readier to returne to their Cloiſters, then to beleue thereoff as the catholike churche do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the. But let that be their faulte, I ſaye not here that you be yeat come ſo farre, which notwithſtanding, youre conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17023:28"/> that you infer (wherefore his ſainges in that epiſtle apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teigne <note place="margin">b. 18.</note> nothing to vs) is falſe. For you ouerthrowe churches, you pull downe altars, you contemne the traditions of the fathers (the diligent obſeruation whereof <hi>S.</hi> Baſile ſaieth in this place was condemned by the Arrians as a greate faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te) beſide other thinges, as maie to them that reade the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories more plainely appeare. So that when you called me dreaming for bringing this as not to the purpoſe, you were belike youre ſelfe nodding.</p>
               <p>Yow aſke: why theſe biſſhoppes of the Eaſte (whoſe epiſtle <note place="margin">Nowell. b. 25.</note> I alleaged here) wrote not to the pope, as head of all the church, but indifferently to all the biſhoppes of Fraunce and Italy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mention of the B. of Rome at all, whereoff yow ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a foliſhe fonde coniecture, and of that, that S. Baſile placed the biſhoppes off Fraunce before the Italian biſſhoppes, which I, (you ſaie) craftely diſſembled, that the B. of Rome ſhoulde not be head of the churche.</p>
               <p>Trulye M. Nowell I neuer brought it to proue the biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Romes ſupremacie: I brought it to proue, that the face of oure time was not muche vnlike to that of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and to that it is not impertinent. For youre demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de I aſke you againe, what if he wrote to the pope ſpeciall lettres for his aide in theſe difficultyes? And if he did, how that ſhould not make greately for his ſupremacie, to who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me he woulde not write as to a common biſhop emongeſt other, but ſeuerally to him ſelfe alone, as being the head of his other brethern. Trulye there is an epiſtle of his not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny before this, written by him to Athanaſius, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring with him about the withſtanding of the Arrians hereſie, he telleth him, that his counſell is, that they ſende lettres to the B. of Rome, <hi>that he may conſidre the matter and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>giue his ſentence, that bicauſe it woulde be verye harde to haue
<pb facs="tcp:17023:29"/> firſt a common councell called, and then ſo to ſende from thence, he him ſelfe choſing mete men for the purpoſe, ſuche as ſhoulde aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well be hable to beare out the paines of the iourney, as for their gentlenes and ſinceritie off manners to warne and reproue ſuche peruerſe men as troubled them, ſhould giue auctoritie to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why might not this epiſtle M. Nowell, be touching the ſame matter whereof he wrote to the biſhoppes of Fraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and Italie? why might it not be that knowing the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that ſee of Rome to be ſo greate as it is, he woulde by no meanes wright vnto the biſhop thereof alone, but ioyntly together with biſhop Athanaſius: whoſe fame he knewe to be in the churche ſuche, that he could aſke no reaſonable petition whiche ſhoulde not be graunted: or what can you ſaye why the epiſtle written to <hi>Meletius,</hi> that they two ſhoulde ſende to Rome for viſitours to viſite their countrie whiche was in the Eaſte, might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 57.</note> this matter? How euer it be, theſe two places argue, that the omitting of the B. of Rome his name here, was not as you ſuppoſe, for contempte of his auctoritie. And thus is this fonde coniecture of youres ſhowed to be vaine and of no force. Now for diſſembling (as you ſaie) the ordre of the biſhoppes named in the epiſtle, truly you ſhewe youre ſelfe to be made euen of the paringes of malice, who iudge ſo maliciouſly where no cauſe is. For to what purpoſe ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulde I conceale that, which no man coulde ſuſpect, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie woulde euer haue bene ſo fooliſhe as to haue brought for an argument againſt the popes ſupremacy?</p>
               <p>It foloweth: S. Baſile with the other biſhoppes of the Eaſte, <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 13. a. 3.</note> called the biſhoppes alltogether brethern and felowes in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, which they would neuer haue done, had they had this opi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion of his ſupremacy, that M. Dorman and other papiſtes do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17023:29"/> defende and maintaine. But in the ſaide 70. epiſtle the ſaide biſhops of the Eaſt, which do not once ſpeake of the pope, do pray the Frenche and Italian biſshoppes to make humble ſute to the Emperoure, that he by his auctoritie woulde repreſſe their enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the Arrians, and relieue their miſeries, which maketh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Emperours ſupremacy in the churche then for the biſhoppes of Rome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> tolde you a litle before of <hi>S.</hi> Baſile his counſell to <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> Athanaſius, to ſende to the biſhop of Rome for helpe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist.</hi> 52.</note> the Arrians. Wherby as it appeareth to be more then probable, that theſe latter lettres were written to the other biſhoppes of Italie and fraunce only, not to the pope: ſo is it euident alſo, that the mention of the emperour and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the pope, came not of lacke of acknowledging his auctoritie, (to the which before they fledde) but of this, by ioyning bothe the ſwordes together, the ſpirituall and the temporall, the rather to vanquiſhe and diſcomfite the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. But nowe if it were ſo that emongeſt the reſt the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome had bene comprehended in this epiſtle, yeat the calling of him brother or felowe in the miniſterie, is no cauſe to conclude (as you doe) againſt his auctoritie. For neither doe I nowe, nor euer hathe anie Catholike hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ſo defended or mainteined the popes ſupremacy that it hathe not bene allwaies acknowledged, that bothe he and other biſhoppes be the miniſtres of one common maiſter, allthough that maiſter haue made him the ruler of his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes and ouerſeer of his brethren. Yea the popes them ſelues haue euer vſed to call the other biſhoppes their <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> and <hi>felowe biſhoppes,</hi> not renouncing therby the aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of their ſeate. What marueile is it therfore, if the biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes of the Eaſt had called the pope (emongeſt the other to whome they wrote) brother and felowe in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, by the which name he calleth him ſelfe, it can not
<pb facs="tcp:17023:30"/> be denied.</p>
               <p>Nowe where M. Dorman ſpeaketh of perſecution, as he dyd <note place="margin">Nowell.

               <p>Here you compell me to entre with you into a diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation about altars.

And that S Paule calleth it <hi>menſam domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicam</hi> oure Lordes table.</p>
               <p>To the facte of Chriſt maye be anſwered two wayes. <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> Firſt, that we conſidre not in this word <hi>(altar)</hi> ſo muche the matter whereof it is made, as we doe the thing which is executed vpon it. For it is not ſtone that maketh it to be called an altar: no more then wood, ſiluer or golde, but it is the ſacrifice done vpon it which maketh it ſo to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. So that when Chriſt our ſauiour inſtituted this ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or oblation of the newe teſtament (as namely the auncient father Irineus calleth it) although (as yow ſaye) <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Li.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 32</note> men had in thoſe daies in their houſes no altars in ſtede of tables, yeat was this table made an altar by Chriſtes offring him ſelfe thereapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Again if you will yeat reaſon that becauſe it was a table of wood or a woodden altar, therefore we muſt change the ordre off Chriſtes churche, and downe with oure ſtone altars and ſet vp tables of wood: then muſt I anſwere you, that this was one of the thinges, which oure ſauiour determined nothing of, but lefte to the diſcretion <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſt. epiſt.</hi> 118.</note> of his Apoſtles by whom he would diſpoſe the buſines of the church, and that by the ſame very mene that you wolud haue altars pulled downe, you may alſo ouersthrow chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. <note place="margin">b. 13.

               <p>Yes that I can my ſelfe alone M. Nowell without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> other helpe. Is the firſt epiſtle of S.

If it be, then haue you there expreſſe mention of altars, where the texte ſaieth that they that ſerue the altar ſhall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue by the altar. And againe to the Hebrues: <hi>we haue an altar whereof they maye not eate that ſerue the taberuacle.</hi> Where you <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.</note> can not ſaye, that he ment of any altar other then of the <note place="margin">

It co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in by the waye as it were, that the example is founde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the B. of Rome and <hi>Nouatus</hi> going from his vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and <hi>Maximus</hi> returning to it. Any other example would haue ſerued my turne in this behalfe, but the caſe ſtanding ſo, that I had to treate of the B. of Rome, thoſe examples liked me beſt which being directly of him, might better declare the vnitie and more liuely ſet furthe the ſchiſme, by how muche the one or the other was greater, as falling from or ioyning with him, who was not a common biſhop but the head or chiefe of all other. Although I might well defende that this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple is ſuche (as is that which foloweth of Vrſatius and Valens) as maye ſerue bothe for my prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to commend vnitie, and for the matter it ſelfe to proue
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17023:40"/> the popes auctoritie by acknowleding thereof. For you ſee here that they confeſſed that there muſt be one biſhop in the catholike churche. Which wordes not withſtanding that you labour to drawe to an other ſenſe, and I denie not but that they haue ſome ambiguitie: Yeat if we conſidre of whome they were ſpoken, that is of <hi>Cornelius</hi> the B. of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and ſucceſſour of Peter, called by <hi>Arnobius</hi> an auncient writer, <hi>Epiſcopus epiſcoporu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the biſhop of biſhopps, it wil not be abſurde to thinke, that by that one biſhop they me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the B. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In pſal.</hi> 138.</note> of Rome ſucceſſour of Peter and ſo the biſhop of biſhoppes.</p>
               <p>Here becauſe no ſmall vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage as you iudge, lieth in the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlating of theſe words in <hi>eccleſia catholica,</hi> you thinke that <note place="margin">Nowell.

               <p>In dede if I were of youre minde that the chaire of S. <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> Peter were but one emongeſt manie like or equall, and his churche as one of the reſt, the tranſlation might well haue bene vſed that you ſpeake of. But whereas I am reſolued and proue it in place, that there is difference betwene S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">

The ſame S. Ambroſe in the funerall oration of his brother Satyrus telleth, that minding to receiue the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſed
<pb facs="tcp:17023:41"/> ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wherby he had a litle before bene ſaued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drowning in the ſea, he aſked the biſhop at whoſe handes he thought to take it, whether he agreed with other catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like biſhoppes, that is (ſaieth S. Ambroſe) with the churche of Rome. What was this elles but to aſke him whether he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with that churche, which becauſe it conteined all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike biſhoppes in her lappe, and none he toke for a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike but him that agreed with that churche: he iudged to be the catholike church. Yow ſee therfore M. Nowel that it is no ſuche abſurditie as yow thinke, to tranſlate theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des <hi>in catholica ecoleſia</hi> in the catholike church. For what pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uileage haue you I praye you more then I, that yow maie tranſlate the worde <hi>catholicae eccleſiae:</hi> of the catholike churche, and that I muſt engliſhe the ſame wordes <hi>of a catholike</hi>

I graunte that in ſome places they are ſo M. Nowell. Will you therefore make a generall rule that they muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be ſo taken, and in no place otherwiſe?</p>
               <p>Muche like to this is the argument that you make <note place="margin">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17023:41"/> called not Cornelius biſhop of the Catholike churche Is not this a goodly kinde of reaſoning? Wil you ſee the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke? M. Nowell preached not at Poules croſſe that there was no ſcripture, no councelles, no doctours, no allowed exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the primitiue churche to proue the ſupremacye of the B. of Rome, <hi>ergo,</hi> M. Iuell did not. I thinke M. Iuell wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulde giue you a good flice out of his benefice vpon the condition that you coulde proue this conſequent to be good. And that thus you reaſon can you not denie. For the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol.</hi> 11.</note> wordes alleaged by me here out of <hi>S.</hi> Cyprian be not Saint Cyprian his, but the verie wordes by his owne confeſsion of the pore penitentes. And therefore to bring a phraſe out of S. Cyprian to proue that becauſe he did not ſo ſaye, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore an other did not, if this were all, were a greate faulte in reaſoning. But now if the wordes had bene in bothe the places S. Cyprians owne, then had youre reaſon bene like to this: M. Nowell preaching before the Quenes highnes at the courte ſaide not that it woulde do him good to raſe his buckler vpon a papiſtes face: ergo, he ſaied not ſo at Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les croſſe.</p>
               <p>You obiect againe againſt this place to be ment of one chiefe biſhop ouer the whole churche, that then as there is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne <note place="margin">Nowell fol. 20. b. 12.</note> onely God and none but he: ſo there ſhoulde be but one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly biſhop and no more but he.</p>
               <p>That were true M. Nowell, if as God is the name off a <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> moſte ſimple nature and excellencie, ſo the name of a biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop were ſuche as woulde admitte no degree of dignitie. When it is ſaide that there is one biſhop in the catholike churche, it is ment one chiefe biſhop. For it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that in all pointes this ſimilitude of one God, and one biſhop ſhoulde agree. It ought to ſuffiſe you, that the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude ſtandeth vpright in that, wherein the compariſon is
<pb facs="tcp:17023:42"/> made, which is here of gouernement: that as one God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth heauen and earthe: ſo there ſhoulde be one chiefe biſhop to gouerne vnder him the churche in earthe. Thus foraſmuche as there be degrees in biſhoppes, though in God there be naturally none (for by abuſe of Idolatres, and by participation of name there be alſo manie Goddes and manie lordes as witneſſeth S. Paule) it is ſufficient, that as <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.</note> there is one God, ſo there ought to be one chiefe biſhop, not excluding the reſte, but referring them to their heade, by meanes whereof and in which ſenſe there is one biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike and one biſhop. And ſo conſequently it foloweth, that my marginall note <hi>of one God: one biſhoppe</hi> (meaning as you ſaye I did) was not in vaine.</p>
               <p>The next obiection of youres, why in this place theſe wordes <hi>one biſhop in the catholike churche,</hi> ſhoulde not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand of one eſpeciall biſhoppe ouer all: you confirme by S. Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in diuerſe places. Firſt by that which he hath of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 21. a. 6 <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Epist.</hi> 9,</note> Biſhop in the firſte booke the 3. epiſtle, then by a ſentence taken out of his epiſtle to Pupianus, afterwardes by certaine wordes of his to Antonius, and laſt of all by that which he hath in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke <hi>de ſimplicitate praelator.</hi> or <hi>de vnitate Eccleſiae.</hi> not farre from the beginning. To the firſt two places youre ſelfe ſeme not mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> to truſt (although folowing the preceptes of youre ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te you are content to vſe them to make a ſhewe of ſtore) either becauſe youre conſcience telleth you that the reaſon foloweth not. <hi>He ſaieth ſo in this place: therefore he muſt nedes ſaye ſo in the other,</hi> either elles, becauſe youre ſelfe perceiued, that there is a greate difference betwene theſe places by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſon of the worde <hi>catholike.</hi> For in the place here alleaged, the ſchiſmatikes returning to the churche confeſſed that there muſt be one biſhop in the catholike churche: in theſe two places auouched by you <hi>S.</hi> Cyprian ſaieth that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies doo ſpring or ariſe by contempt of the biſhop whiche
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17023:42"/> gouerneth the churche and is one. Now as the latter wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des maye according to the circumſtances of the place and here are I doubte not, taken for the ſeuerall heade of euery biſhoprike: ſo the firſte can not well otherwiſe be taken then to exclude all particuler churches, by reaſon of the worde <hi>catholike</hi> which ſignifieth vniuerſall, addid thereto: eſpecially the wordes being tranſlated <hi>the catholike churche</hi> and not a catholike churche, as by youre owne ſo turning of them and otherlike to them it appeareth they muſt. Off the thirde place out of the epiſtle to Antonius you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing neither, but turne the matter ouer to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte auctoritie of S. Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in his boke <hi>De ſimplicitate praelat.</hi> where moſte plainely (you ſaye) he declareth his minde of this one biſhoprike wholly and equally poſſeſſed of all and ouerie bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. Well then at the length M. Nowell from poſt to piller, you be come thither where you will caſt ancre. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I alſo for my parte am well contented, and deſire no better then to be in this controuerſie tried by S. Cyprian.</p>
               <p>Now ſhowe how S. Cyprian maketh for you, that is, nothing for the B. of Rome his ſupremacie, but directly againſt it. For thoſe be the wordes that yow conclude <note place="margin">Nowell. fo. 21. b. 25. <hi>Lib. de Simplicitat. praelator.</hi> Dorman.</note> withall vpon this place. That doe yow after this maner. S. Cyprian ſaieth that there is one biſhoprike which euery biſhop hath wholy for his parte. Ergo, conſequently all biſhoppes be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall and no one can be aboue an other. I denie the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequent M. Nowell. Will yow knowe why? This worde <hi>(epiſcopatus)</hi> comprehendeth here by <hi>S.</hi> Cyprian his minde, the whole nature of that kinde of gouernement which biſhoppes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, as if in like wiſe a man ſhoulde ſaie: <hi>Vnum eſt ſacerdotium</hi> there is one prieſtehode in the churche, which euery pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſte hath wholly for his parte, woulde yow now thinke that vpon this propoſition it were well done to conclude of prieſtes (as yow doe of biſhoppes) that therefore becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:17023:43"/> in nature off prieſtehode they be all equall, the meaneſt as trulye and wholly participating the nature thereof as the chiefe, there ſhoulde be no one prieſt in dignitie of gouernement aboue the other, and ſo ouerthrowe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>archipresbiteri,</hi> chiefe prieſtes, whereof the councell <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Can.</hi> 15. <hi>ite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Concil. Carthag.</hi> 4. <hi>can.</hi> 17.</note> of Toures in Fraunce aboute the time off <hi>Pelagius</hi> the firſt aboue a thouſand yeares paſt maketh mention. But what ſpeke I of prieſthode, will yow condemne the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le churche of Chriſte for making of Archebiſhoppes? I thinke yow wil not. And what ſignifieth this worde Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chebiſhoppe but a chiefe biſhop? If there maye be one chiefe biſhop in euerye prouince, aboue the reſt of his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low biſhoppes, and yeat no hindrance to the reſt or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of their power, that they ſhoulde not be biſhoppes aſwell as he, why maye not the ſame proportion be kept betwene the pope and the reſt of the biſhoppes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, that is betwene the archebiſhop and the other biſhoppes of the prouince? But theſe be but wordes yow ſaye. Call them what you will, they lacke not reaſon, and therefore anſwere them as yow can, for anſwere them you muſt, without you will giue ouer in the plaine fielde. But I will ioyne to reaſon auctoritie, not of any meane writer but euen of S. Auſten him ſelfe, who it is likely vnderſtode as well the meaning of S. Cyprian, as yow M. Nowell. I truſt yow will not be angry with me for ſaing ſo. For as good I ſaye it as other thinke it. The wordes of S.

               <p>

Thus mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che touching youre ſurmiſed compariſon, which if it ſhoulde haue bene made, as you imagine, then muſt yow either condemne S.

To proue this he vſeth a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon, in this wiſe. <hi>Epiſcopatus vnus eſt,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17023:44"/> &amp;c.

Cyprian ment as you do, or no.</p>
               <p>Imagine you therfore with S. Cypr. this whole biſhoprike <note place="margin">The biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprike of the churche compared to a tree.</note> of the church to be a tree, the bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches wherof be the biſhop pes ſeuered, the bodie of the tree the ſame biſhoppes ioyned together, the roote, the chiefe biſhoppe that holdeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Except this be the meaning of S. Cyprian, you can not make this compariſon agree. For the waye to make the things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared agree, is (becauſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues both the bowes of the tree, and biſhoppes of the church are many) to reduce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to one beginning. And as the ſame thing that maketh the tree one is a membre and parte thereof: ſo muſt that which ſhall make the biſhoprike one, be a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre of the ſame biſhoprike, that is to ſaye, a biſhop, although in that reſpect that he is a parte of the ſame bodie, equall with the reſt, as the roote by being of one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with the bodie and bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches, is aboue the other partes of the tree not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, becauſe they are all made one thereby; and take theire life thereof, as appeareth at the eye.

Is it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> impertinent that they confeſſe of the pope, that he hath pardoned them their faulte, whereas of Athanaſius there is no ſuch worde?

               <p>It is a worthy thing to be noted, howe you continue <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> allwaies like youre ſelfe, in feeding the reader with vaine matter nothing to the purpoſe, and alleaging ſuche places as yow bring otherwiſe then they are in the Originalls from whence you take them. For loke in Platine once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and you ſhall finde, that the wordes be not ſo odiouſe as you woulde haue them ſeme to be.

               <p>That you ſaie, that neither the texte of the ſcriptures, nor the <note place="margin">fol. 27. b. 7.</note> interpretation of doctours, nor iudgementes of councelles can haue any credite againſt the pope, and bring Pighius to proue it, that is a manifeſt lye. For when Pighius ſaieth that for the <note place="margin">A lye. 22.</note> moſte parte there is nothing done in generall councelles, but that the biſhoppes comming together giue their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to that which the Apoſtolike See decreed before, he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieth not that it is ſo allwaies, that it can be no otherwiſe? As though the time of deliberation during, the Apoſtolike See vpon the reaſons of the councell might not be moued to decree that which otherwiſe it hath not determined: he ſaieth not that againſt the pope neither the texte of the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, nor the interpretation of doctours, nor iudgementes of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles <note place="margin">b. 24.</note> can haue any credite. And therefore moſte impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (againe I tell yow) yow haue belyed Pighius. The

And therefore you haue Pighius at no ſuch aduantage, becauſe he ſaieth that the onely iudgement of the See of Rome is more ſure then the iudgement of an vniuerſall councell of the whole worlde. which if it be true <note place="margin">VVhy councelles be called.</note> then were it (you ſaye) for biſhoppes to come to councelles a vaine thing. Not ſo M. Nowell: For although before God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and with good men, the iudgement arreſted vpon by the ſee of Rome be certeinly true and can not deceiue, yeat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men ignorant in the ſcriptures and lawes of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che: ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſometimes, becauſe heretikes for the repreſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing of whome councelles be moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called, for the moſte parte be not thus perſuaded, the pope vſeth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the generall councell concerning decrees to be made. The which being with generall conſent appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and confirmed by the pope, bothe the weake or vnle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned catholike maie be fully perſuaded, and the ſtubborne heretike with his owne weightes quite ouer weighed: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le bothe to the one and the other ſuche vniforme conſent, can not but argue the merueilouſe grace and aſsiſtence off the holie goſt. An other cauſe maie be, for that the pope by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> this meanes will be certified by the biſhoppes off euery countrie, what circumſtances, what maners of people in eache place, maie require the decrees according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of diuerſe diſeaſes, to be loſed ſlacker or ſtreined har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For although he be ſo priuileaged that in making la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes for the churche he can not erre, yeat hath he not the ſpirit of prophecie to knowe being abſent all the offenſes and imperfections in the churche. Beſide this where as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it might euer be doubted whether the pope made any ſuche decrees or no in places farre diſtant from Rome, hereby all ſuche occaſion is taken awaie, the biſhoppes off

Laſt of all this calling together of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> councelles is not in vaine, while Chriſtian princes being preſent and hearing all thinges debated, promiſe the rather their aſsiſtance for the execution of ſuche thinges as ſhalbe concluded.

               <p>When I minded to handle in writing the preeminence and ſuperioritie of the B. of Rome ouer Chriſtes vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall and catholike churche, and conſidered firſt that the ſcripture it ſelfe, then the fathers and councelles: finally the examples of the primitiue churche alowed the ſame: I laied for a fundation to builde vpon, that there muſt nedes be one heade in Chriſtes churche to gouerne it. Not as though if to the wiſdome of him who dothe in his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome all thinges it had ſo ſemed, the gouernement of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratie, that is to ſaie, <hi>off the beſt and wiſeſt men</hi> might not haue bene preferred by him which is Lorde ouer nature before the rule of Monarchie, that is of one alone, whiche is moſte agreable to nature. And for this cauſe I ſaied that of neceſsitie it muſt ſo be. Which neceſsitie if I had not bene able to proue (as the contrarie ſhall hereafter appeare, by that, that you keping youre ſelfe to the title of youre boke haue onely reproued and not diſproued anie one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſon off myne) yeat muſt all men off neceſsitie nedes confeſſe, that ſeing Chriſt committed in the ſcriptures the whole charge of his church to only Peter, giuing him aucto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie to feede al, La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bes, and ſhepe: ſeing that the fathers with <note place="margin">

               <p>I ſaide that the ſtate of goddes people in the olde la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we, and experience of ciuile gouernement did proue the <note place="margin">Nowell Fol. 29. 2. 23.</note> neceſsitie of one heade. Yow anſwere: that as goddes people in the olde law were one ſeueral people and had one high prieſt, ſo that no further can be gathered thereof, but that likewiſe in euery dioceſſe or countrie it were good to haue one chiefe biſhop to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le in the cleargie.</p>
               <p>Oh M. Nowell, think you thus to ouerbeare youre pore <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> neighbours? You muſt remembre, yow muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre, that you fight againſt truthe, that will not ſo be outfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. You muſt remembre, that when we talke of the Iewes as of the people of God, we doe not in that point recon them as one ſeuerall people. They were in dede ſeuerall, in reſpect of other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which had forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, but neuer in ſuch ſorte ſeueral, as though the whole church of god were not vnder the gouernemnet of their lawe and chiefe prieſt. They were therefore a figure, not onelie of one dioceſſe or one countrie, but of the whole churche that now is, and made the churche that then was. And ſo the example hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſtill.</p>
               <p>You make my reaſon taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of kingdomes, <note place="margin">

But I pray you what is this to the purpoſe whoſe it be, except yow doe this to ſhewe youre ſelfe to be a man of greate reading, and ignorant neither in the olde writers nor in thoſe of latter time. What ſo euer yow make of me, or how ſo euer it pleaſe you to take me: I am not iwiſſe ſo verye a dolt but I could haue made this reaſon euen by the experience of thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges which ronne dailie into myne eyes, and neuer haue lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

               <p>Whoſe argument or reaſon ſo euer it be blinde yow ſaie it is. That let indifferent eyes trye M. Nowell. I reaſon thus: <hi>Euery kingdome hath his ſeuerall king: euery people, citie, towne village, houſe and ſo furthe, haue their ſeuer all head or gouernour.</hi> ergo: <hi>the whole churche which is but one, diuided into many mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bres</hi> (as ſaieth S.

                  <note place="margin">b. 11.</note> in likewiſe euerye dioceſſe, and euery churche ought to haue their ſeuerall heade prelate or biſhop. I toke not my reaſon oute off S.

What ſo euer it be my reaſon is, that the whole churche diſperſed through the whole worlde, is as truly one kingdome of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auen, one ſocietie, one body, as any other company throu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe oute the worlde is one, be it greate or litle. Therefore if I had concluded as S. Cyprian dothe, vpon your graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame to be true (as here you ſaye you woulde haue done) that euerye dioceſſe and particuler churche nedeth a heade, it woulde well haue folowed ſpite of youre bearde, ergo, in the whole churche being alſo one, is more nede of one heade. Theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſions of <hi>S.</hi> Cipria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and mine be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary but ſtande wel together.

               <p>This is S. Cyprian his reaſon, this is (you ſaie) his concluſion. You beelye S. Cyprian M. Nowel: he neither reaſoneth nor <note place="margin">fol. 30. b. 30.</note> concludeth againſt the ſupremacy of one, as I truſt I haue made euident. You might rather thinke that he who was for euery portion ſo hofull, woulde be no leſſe carefull to prouide for the whole, where was more daunger and cauſe of feare. For that you reaſon after youre maner negatiuely, that neither S. Cyprian nor any other learned man doth vſe theſe examples or ſimilitudes any where, to proue that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ought to be one heade or gouernour ouer the vniuerſall churche: that reaſon ſhoweth it ſelfe from whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. Will you now as you haue taught vs a newe kinde of diuinitie, ſo teache vs alſo a newe waye of reaſoning? Yea will you teache the learned Lawiers and graue iudges off the realme neuer to decide caſe but ſuche as they ſhall fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de recorded in their yeare bokes in the ſame termes? Shall it not be laufull for them by youre depe diuinitie, whereas it is impoſsible ſo to conceiue lawes that all caſes maye be expreſſely comprehendid, when ſuche a caſe ſhall happen, to procede therein by the iudgement giuen in other caſes, where although the caſe be diuerſe the reaſon is one? Iff youre diſcretion will ſerue you to alowe this kinde of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning in the lawe, whiche is nothing elles but altogether reaſon: why take you then ſuche holde of this, that S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian did not in termes, that is to ſaye in the ſelfe ſame caſe of one heade ouer the vniuerſall churche, applye theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, ſeing that as I proued before, S. Cyprians reaſon is one in bothe the caſes, yea greater and of more force in the <note place="margin">fol. 30. b. 31.</note> caſe of one heade ouer the whole church, then of one ouer euery particuler churche.</p>
               <p>Becauſe M. Nowell thinketh as the truthe is, that this concluſion, <hi>that there ought to be one generall heade ouer all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17023:58"/> churches</hi> liketh me well, and yeat that I haue handled it but ill: it pleaſeth him here of an extraordinarye liberalitie for the pitie that he taketh vpon me, to playe once againe the ſcholemaiſter in his olde dayes, and now becauſe I am paſt my Grammer to teache me logike. I ſhoulde haue reaſoned thus my maiſter ſaieth: There is one generall king ouer al the <note place="margin">Nowell. fo. 31. a. 2.</note> worlde, one generall heade ouer all people &amp;c. Therefore there muſt be one generall heade ouer all the churche.</p>
               <p>My maiſter plaieth here with me, as S. Thomas More <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> writeth that a poet of Cambridge did once with his boye whome (plaing with him being a yong Sophiſter on a time for his pleaſure) he offred to proue an aſſe: which when the boye denied, well quoth the poet thow wilt graunte me this firſt, that euery thing that hath two eares is an aſſe. Nay mary maiſter will I not quoth the boye. No wilt thow quoth the poete? Ah wyly boye there thow wenteſt beyond me. For and thow wouldeſt haue graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me that, I woulde haue proued the an aſſe anon. Mary maiſter quoth the boye ye might well, and ſo might euery foole toe. Well quoth the poet I will goe now an other waye to worcke with the. Thow wilt graunt me that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie aſſe hath two eares. Naye marie will I not maiſter quoth the boye. Why ſo boye quoth he. Mary maiſter quoth he, ſome aſſe maie happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue neuer a one, for they maie be cut of bothe. Naye then quoth the poet I giue the ouer, thow arte to frowarde a boye for me. Woulde not yow now M. Nowell make me here to reaſon as pleaſeth you, as the poet woulde haue made his boye to anſwere? But how little nede I haue of youre helpe (God I thanke therefore) to frame this reaſon to my purpoſe, the argument made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will ſpeake though I holde my peace. In the meane ſeaſon this of youres might haue ſome probabilitie, if as
<pb facs="tcp:17023:59"/> Chriſte hath appointed one churche: ſo God had aſsigned one kingdome in the whole worlde. But ſeing that from the time the tongues were diſperſed in Babilon, many ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall companies of men, and not long after many ſeuerall <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.</note> nations: and conſequently manie ſeuerall heades were ſo appointed by God, that whether it were for the paine of ſinne, or elles to haue the partes of the earthe more quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabited, ones they were not one of them bounde to be vnder the other, nor all to be vnder one heade in earthe (whereas on the other ſide Chriſt came to gather together <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.</note> the diſperſed of Iſrael in to one bodye, one kingdome, one folde, and all the churches in the worlde be reduced accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to one churche, which can not be ſaide of all the kingdomes) for you nowe to requier no more one heade in the churche, then there is one king in the worlde, it is ſuche a kinde of argument, as I thinke beſide youre ſelfe it would haue bene harde to haue founde one other ſo fooliſhe that woulde haue made it.</p>
               <p>What D. Harding ſaieth out of Homere or Ariſtotle it <note place="margin">fol. 31. a. 15</note> maketh no matter to me, allbeit it proueth verye well that thoſe Gentiles ſawe, that the gouernement of one bodye belongeth to one heade. And therefore if they had bene as verilie perſuaded then, that the whole worlde is but one kingdome, as you are that the churche is but one bodie, as they woulde of all likelihod haue concluded that it had not bene good to haue manie rulers: ſo liuing now and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſuaded the like of the churche, it is not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but that they woulde haue bene touching the ſame off the ſame opinion. As for that that you adde ſcoffingly to deface it, that it is M. D. Hardinge his poeticall argument for the popes ſupremacie. I praie you be good M. Nowell to poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos, of whome you ſauour ſo muche in youre ſermones and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17023:59"/> writinges, and who the time hathe bene, were the faireſt floure in youre garland. Otherwiſe you will giue men oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion bothe to thinke and to ſaie, that the olde prouerbe is true in you, that the pariſhe prieſte remembreth not that once he was pariſhe clercke. But I praie you maye it be laufull for you to folowe poetes in lieng as you doe, and maie not other men alleage for their purpoſe, one graue ſentence of a poete: yea all were it ſo that it were directly to proue the popes ſupremacie as this is not ſo brought in? If it be ſo, then ſcoffe alſo hardely at S. Paule, who to proue the omnipotent power of God, alleaged the ſentence of the <note place="margin">

               <p>Thus in oure preſent queſtion doth M.

               <p>Not ſo M. Nowell, the reaſon of difference betwe theſe

But to come to the church which as it is one, ſo hath it by Chriſt one faith, the ſame lawes, the ſame ſacramentes deliuered to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all that wilbe membres thereof, without varietie in matters of ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: here what nede is thereof one head, that this one faith may be of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and euery where inuiolably holden? Seing that euen in kingdomes and common wealthes dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience telleth vs, that how well and quietly ſo euer ſuch kinges and rulers gouerne their ſubiectes, them ſelues they be not yeat hable ſo to gouerne (while I proude and thou proude eche one thinketh him ſelfe as good as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) that they can abſteine from mortal and cruel battaile, wherby their innocent people periſhe ful ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on both ſides moſt miſerably.

Will you nedes be of the nombre of thoſe naughty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate men? Well M.

In this pointe becauſe the verye neceſſitie of one heade to gouerne Chriſtes churche dothe ſpecially conſiſt: I ſhall deſire the learned reader to vſe good circumſpection, and with aduiſed deliberation to waye with him ſelfe the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons brought on bothe ſides. I obiect therefore to M. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, that for the appeaſing of ſchiſmes, and reſtoring the church being troubled to quietnes, <hi>it is neceſſary that there be one chiefe heade.</hi> He maketh me anſwere as you heard before, that the ſeuerall chiefe prelates of euery prouince are aſwell able <note place="margin">An abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne that ſchiſmes may as wel be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed by manie he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ades as by one.</note> to take ordre therfore, as the ſeuerall gouernours of euery coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie for their ſeuerall charges. The abſurditie of this anſwere ſhall appeare by a demonſtration. There is nowe a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie in their newe churche of Englande about no ſmall matter, but concerning the reall preſence of Chriſtes bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:17023:62"/> bodie in the ſacrament: M. Geſt preaching at Rocheſter for the reall preſence, M. Grindall at London for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Shall theſe two prelates be tried by M. D. Parkar of Cauntorbury ſuſpected to be a Lutheran? Although that I thinke M. Nowel would be lothe to graunte being him ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe a Caluiniſt, yeat if he did, and the matter were thorou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghly decided on the one ſide: might not the like ſchiſme ariſe in the prouince of Yorke, and bachiler Yong there calling his brethern together determine the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſy on the other ſide? If this ſhoulde happen (as it eaſely might) in this equalitie of power betwene theſe two in theſe ſeuerall prouinces, how ſhould the ſchiſme be appeaſed? They wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de perhappes procure a parliament to be called, that by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie thereof the matter might be determined. Were the biſhoppes that coulde not agree before, like the ſooner to forſake their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentiouſe mindes by this meanes? Or ſhould the matter be put only to the debating of the laitie? Or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we euer it were, the matter being brought thither, and then the ordre of the houſe being ſuche, that it muſt paſſe as wel through the lower houſe as the higher, might not the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe be equally diuided, or the thinge brought to ſo narowe a pointe, that the concluſion of this weightie controuerſie might depende vpon the mouthe of ſome ſimple burgoiſe and meane artificer, who might eaſely by lacke of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment chooſe the worſe part? Or if they all agreed vpon the truthe, might not the like controuerſie, ariſe in Fraunce, Germanie, Spaine, or in ſome other countrie, and euery one determine either in this article, or any lyke, contrary to the other? If they did, as by the confesion of Augſpurg, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir communion boke allowed by the parliament of Englan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de, the one ſo muche diſagreing with the other it appeareth they doe, ſhoulde not the churche in this caſe be miſerably
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17023:62"/> ſhaken notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the labour of the chiefe prelates of euery prouince? Now to come to princes, and te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, if they haue as many ſeueral or contrary lawes as their be ſeuerall countries or nations, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the keping of their people in ciuile ordre and peace, what breache off vnitie? What hurte? What diſordre in the worlde will fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe hereof I praye you? So that to haue made this reaſon of youres probable, you ſhoulde thus haue reaſoned. As in the whole worlde there is no diſordre, becauſe ſeuerall princes haue ſeuerall and contrary lawes: ſo in the churche will there be alſo none, if diuerſe biſhoppes teache diuerſe and contrary faithes. But as no man is ſo blinde but he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the falſehode of this compariſon: ſo is no man I truſte ſo voide of wit but that he ſeeth this to be as true, as that which you made before.</p>
               <p>Thus by reaſon we finde, that ſchiſmes can not be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed without one heade in the churche, to whome the greater cauſes ought to be referred, whome the reſt ought to credite and obeye. To the which heade becauſe he is by Chriſtes owne mouthe ſo priuileaged in Peters faithe, that as he neuer yeat deliuered to the churche any erroniouſe doctrine to be beleued, but hathe allwaies continued the faith receiued from the Apoſtles, ſo are we ſuer that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall: we ought and maye in matters of faithe giue full and aſſured credite. As by S. Auſten we be counceled, who to this purpoſe bringeth this ſaing of the ghoſpell: <hi>Quae di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>facite &amp;c.</hi> Doe what they bidde you doe, and addeth for the reaſon, <hi>that in ſo doing, oure faithe being moſte certaine, as being grounded not vpon man but vpon goddes promiſe, can neuer be ſcattred by the tempeſt of anie ſchiſme.</hi> This being moſt true, we maie boldely conclude, that this ſtate of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, that is of gouerning the churche by one heade, as it is
<pb facs="tcp:17023:63"/> moſte neceſſarie, ſo becauſe we are ſuer that this one heade can not giue wrong iudgement in matters of faithe, it is of all other for the churche the moſte conuenient, as being the verie beſt. For in this pointe doe all men agree, euen the moſte aduerſaries to this ſtate, that if one Monarche were ſuer allwaies to gouerne well, that then that ſtate off gouernement were to be preferred before all other.</p>
               <p>To all this that hathe bene ſaide maye be added, that iff you will nedes haue the ſeuerall dioceſſes and churches off euerie biſhoprike to be like ſeueral kingdomes, then as there is no only kingdome in earthe: ſo by you it ſhoulde folowe that there is no one only churche in earthe. Or if it may be enough for the church in earthe to be one body becauſe Chriſte in heauen is the one heade thereof: why maie not then the kingdomes of the earthe be in earthe one, becauſe Chriſte in heauen is the king of them alſo? This being not I thinke vnknowen vnto you, howe vneuen this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of youres was made, yow will nowe leauing youre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſon, trie the matter by auctoritie.</p>
               <p>S. Cyprian (yow ſaie) dothe moſt plainely teache that <note place="margin">Nowell. fo. 32. a. 30</note> it is right and reaſon, that ſeuerall biſhoppes haue the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſeuerall dioceſſes, euen for the ſame cauſe for the which I (yow ſaye) doe vntruly alleage the neceſsitie of one heade.</p>
               <p>To the place of S. Cyprian beginning: <hi>Cum ſtatutum ſit</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Dorman. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>omnibus nobis &amp;c.</hi> I anſwere: that it is right and reaſon that ſeuerall biſhoppes haue the gouernement of ſeuerall dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, and that to appeaſe ſchiſmes and correcte vices, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as theſe thinges maie be in ſuche ſeueral dioceſſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly done. But that this maie be allwaies perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in particuler biſhoprikes, and that if it can not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe maie not be had to higher power, that yow ſhoulde haue proued, and that S. Cyprian hathe not. Therefore this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17023:63"/> place maketh not againſt the auctoritie of one heade. But you force it further and ſaie.</p>
               <p>S. Cyprian affirmeth all ſuche appellations from a biſhop off <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> one countrie to a biſhop of an other countrey to be vnlaufull, for that, that all biſhoppes of all countreys be of like auctoritie, and that none but naughtie and deſperate men doe thinke the auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſome biſhoppes to be inferiour to the auctoritie of other.</p>
               <p>S Cyprian affirmeth not here that all appellations from <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> one biſhop to an other be vnlaufull. He ſaieth that it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and hathe bene ordeined emongeſt them, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes of euery biſhop haue their cauſes hearde, there where the faulte was committed. And maye not the B. of Rome doe this by ſending his legates in all ſuch caſes of appeale to the places where the offences were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there to examine the proceſſe, to receiue witnes, to determine the matter? Beſide this, if <hi>S.</hi> Cyprian had in this place vttrely forbidden all maner of appeales to Rome: yeat by the phraſe of his wordes it appeareth, that it <hi>was decreed emongeſt them</hi> by a locall ſtatute of their owne, for the better maintenaunce of brothrely concorde. Which as it exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded no fardre then to that place: ſo if anie of them that once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to that ordre, refuſe at anie time to obey it, although it ought to be a barre to him that once gaue his conſent to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, yeat is it none to the pope, why he maie not pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cede in the cauſe (who neuer renounced his right) if it be ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pealed to him. The like to this is to be ſeene in the colleages of oure vniuerſities, where the founders in moſt places ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ordeined by their ſtatutes, that the membres of ſuch col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leages for the better reteining and vpholding of quiet and brotherly agrement emongeſt them, ſhall propoſe ſuche quarelles and contentions as happen emongeſt them to the ſeuerall heades of ſuche colleages. This ordre thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="tcp:17023:64"/> right and reaſon woulde haue kepte, but if ſome fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde body not contented with this, will complaine furder to the chauncelor of the vniuerſitie or chiefe patron of his colleage, he may at their handes haue iuſtice. That this was the caſe that S. Cyprian ſpeaketh of, manie thinges may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade. Firſt that he ſaieth: <hi>Cùm ſtatutu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſit omnibus nobis</hi> wheras an ordre is taken emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt vs all, he giueth vs two thinges to vnderſtande, that whereas they toke ſuche an ordre emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt <note place="margin">S.

And therfore you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue done lewdly and made alowde lie M. Nowel, to gather of this place, this generall propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that all appellations from the biſhop of one countrie to the biſhop of an other be vnlaufull. Whereas this ordre being taken only in Afrike by common <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cypr. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>epist.</hi> 4.</note> conſent of the Africans, was not in Spaine, as appeareth by the appealing from thence of Baſilides to Rome. Which if it had bene vnlaufull, neuer woulde S. Cyprian we may be ſuer, haue made other exception why the ſentence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Stephanus the pope for his reſtitution ſhoulde not be good, then this, becauſe it was giuen by him that was no iudge at all, of all other the beſt and moſte peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: neuer would he haue obiected that it was obteined by falſe ſuggeſtion and wrong information, which argueth the goodnes and validitie of the appellation of it ſelfe. But what ſpeake I of Spaine, when S. Cyprian his owne labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Li.</hi> 1. <hi>ep.</hi> 3.</note> at Rome with the pope by lettres, by legates, by all meanes poſsible, that this vniuſt appeale might not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, when his counting to ſaile after them, to conuince
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17023:64"/> their lieng tongues by vndoubted and aſſured proufe of the truthe, ought ſufficiently to make faithe, that ſeing the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe had neuer confirmed this locall ſtatute of theirs, and therby not renounced his right: ſeing his ſubiectes againſt the ordre taken had appealed to Rome, he muſt alſo nedes anſwere the appeale, for the vnlaufulnes wherof on their partes that folowed it, he alleageth here their own conſent, in theſe words <hi>omnibus nobis,</hi> agreed by al vs, to moue therby the rather the B. of Rome not to receiue their appeale, but to remit the cauſe home againe.</p>
               <p>Whereas you ſaie that S. Cyprian hathe, that none but naughty and deſperate men doe thinke the auctoritie of ſome biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes to be inferiour to the auctoritie of other, ſurely yow go about bothe to proue youre ſelfe, S.

You condemne in like maner the auncient ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall councelles and continuall practiſe of the catholike churche. For who is ſo ignorant that he knoweth not, that the bookes of the learned fathers, the cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient councells, the vſage of Chriſtes churche, haue ſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly alwaies obſerued this difference of biſhoppes, that the verie names of patriarkes, primates, Archebiſhoppes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined allwaies and vſed in the churches, are able to conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce him to be an impudent lier that ſhall ſuſteine the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Youre ſelfe confeſſe, that there be chiefe prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in euery prouince. If chiefe, Ergo inferious. You call him a naughty and deſperate man that thinketh the auctoritie of ſome biſhoppes to be inferiour to the auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of other. Yow ſaye the ſame youre ſelfe by graunting that there be chiefe prelates. Hauing ſought all the meanes that my pore witte can inuent to exempt yow from this companie of naughty and deſperate men, I finde no other
<pb facs="tcp:17023:65"/> then this, that perhappes you only ſaye it for a ſhift, and thinke it not in deede. But if you were to be accounted naught and deſperate for this, yeat had you in this reſpecte cauſe to reioyce, that yow were like to haue the companie of <hi>S.</hi> Auſten: who telleth Bonifacius the pope, that in the <note place="margin">

And agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne comparing Innocentius the pope with Irinaeus, Cipri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Hilary, he hath: <hi>Cum his Innocentius Romanus Pontifex conſedit, etſi poſterior tempore, prior loco.</hi> With theſe ſate Innocentius the biſhop of Rome, although behinde them <note place="margin">

Yea to comfort you the more, I dare promiſe yow the companie of S. Cyprian him ſelfe. For if he had not bene of the minde that ſome biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes are inferiour to other in iuriſdiction, althoughe not in the ſubſtance or nature of biſhoply ordre, woulde he haue exhorted, yea and required the B. of Rome to write lettres in to Fraunce, to direct them to the prouince and people of Arles, wherby they ſhoulde depoſe Martianus the B. the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re? <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>epi. ſtol.</hi> 3.</note> With what face could he haue done this had he thought that the auctoritie of one biſhop were no greater then that of an other? But here you will vrge me that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſhewe by probable coniectures that in theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Saint Cyprian had no ſuche meaning, vnleſſe I ſhowe withal what was his meaning. Yes verily M. Nowell it were enough for me to proue that the ſenſe which you giue to theſe wordes of his coulde not be true, but for their ſakes
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17023:65"/> who deſire to knowe not onely what is falſe, but what is all ſo true, I will open that pointe to. This is therefore by this epiſtle of S. Cyprian moſte euident, that theſe naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men who complained vpon S. Ciprian at Rome, went firſt before they toke their iourney to Rome in to <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and there ioyned them ſelues to certeine hereticall biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes of whome <hi>Fortunatus</hi> was made a biſhop, and ſo by reaſon that none were made biſhoppes that ſtode ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate it muſt nedes be that he was by them firſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued. Theſe hereticall biſhoppes of <hi>Numidia,</hi> theſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſubiectes of his owne, who demaunded helpe and com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plained where they ought not, he calleth by the name of a fewe loſt and deſperate men, who had attempted and done ſo manie thinges to the derogation of the auctoritie of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir owne primate, and ſubmitted them ſelues to the vnlau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full auctoritie of heretical and ſchiſmaticall biſhoppes, <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi minor videatur eſſe authoritas epiſcoporum in Africa con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutorum.</hi> As though the auctoritie ſeme to be leſſe of the African biſhoppes, then of thoſe of Numidia (we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye) who toke vpon them to defende and mainteine <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus</hi> and his felowes condemned in Africa before. By which is ment Africa the leſſer wherein Carthage ſtoode, from which <hi>Numidia</hi> was a diſtincte prouince, whereas yow M. Nowell take Africa for the whole, as it is counted the thirde parte of the worlde, pretending as thoughe no one biſhop of the other two partes of the worlde had more auctoritie then the biſhoppes of Africa. Excepte this be the meaning of the place, you can not excuſe S. Cyprian of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to him ſelfe, as by the auctoritie acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by him in the pope, in Fraunce, in Spaine in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, as you haue hearde, as by the calling in this verye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle the churche of Rome the mother churche and roote
<pb facs="tcp:17023:66"/> of the catholike churche, it dothe manifeſtly appeare. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of ſo graue an auctor is not to be thought. To conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de therefore, S. Cyprian dothe not here forbid all appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> from a biſhop of one countrie to the B. of an other: He ſaieth not that all biſhoppes be of like auctoritie, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> none but naughtie and deſperate men doe thinke the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> auctoritie of ſome biſhoppes to be inferiour to other.

               <p>You repeate againe, (as that is a greate figure with you) <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 33. a. 6.</note> that which yow ſaide before, that it is impoſsible that there ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de be one generall heade in earthe ouer the vniuerſall churche, or that ſuche a heade can ouerſee his charge, and kepe all churches from ſchiſmes and troubles, and pacifie them when they are riſen.

               <p>As for the impoſsibilitie I anſwered before, and ſaie agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, <note place="margin">Dorman. fol. 50. b.</note> that how euer it ſeme impoſsible (the weake nature off ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered), yeat ſuer we are that he that appointed that ordre, God him ſelfe, is ſo able to multiplye grace in his miniſtre, and to prouide him of ſuche helpe by the meanes of other inferiour miniſtres gouerning their ſeuerall char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges vnder him, that it ſhall not only not be impoſsible but eaſy enough.

For I am not as yeat come to proue the pope to be ſupreame heade of Chriſtes churche, but am only in the prouing hereof, that it is neceſſarie that there be one ſuche heade. If you woulde nedes comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolle the alleaging of this place, you ſhoulde ſhowe that <hi>S.</hi> Cyprian ſpeaketh not at all, of anie neceſsitie to haue anye one heade or iudge in the ſtede of Chriſte obeied in earthe, neither in particuler churches, neither yeat ouer the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal churche.

I had thought M. Nowell that you had knowen the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion that is betwene the parte and the whole, the leſſe and the greater in the ſame kinde. If one villaige can not conſiſt without a heade, muche leſſe can one citie, and yeat leſſe can one ſhiere, and leſt of all can a prouince or whole kingdome. Nowe when we ſpeake of the churche, one dioceſſe is in reſpecte of the whole churche, as one vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laige, towne, or ſhiere is in reſpecte of a whole prouince or kingdome. As therfore it is not ſufficient for the quiet gouerning of a prouince or kingdome, that euery village and citie within the ſame haue a ſeuerall heade to ouerſee
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17023:67"/> the inhabitantes of ſuche villaiges, or cities, without there be beſide one generall heade to ouerſee all thoſe infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour heades: Euen ſo the ſeuerall gouernours in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer dioceſſes, exclude not, but inferre by a ſtronger rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the neceſsitie of one heade ouer all other heades in <note place="margin">Chriſtes being he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade of the Churche, excludeth not the miniſterie of man.</note> the whole churche. Which reaſon you can not ſhift awaie by ſaing that Chriſte is that only heade: for ſo (it maie be truly replied to you) he is of all the particuler churches in the worlde toe. And yeat (this not withſtanding) as there woulde hereſies and ſchiſmes riſe in particuler churches if (to vſe S.

Denye if you can, that thus manie yeares the whole worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de hathe not in ſpirituall matters obeyed one heade the B. of Rome? I preſſe you not nowe with the firſt ſix hundred yeares before, in the which the eccleſiaſticall hiſtories and writinges of the fathers make moſte euident mention, that this auctoritie of one generall heade, was thorough out the whole worlde acknowledged of all men.

               <p>As for the reaſon whereunto the Apologie and yow le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane, that as God hathe giuen to no one king to be aboue all, ſo to no one biſhop to rule the whole churche, that is as I tolde you before, to appoint God, becauſe he hathe made manie kingdomes to make many heades of the churche which is but one, and ſo conſequently to multiply religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and make many faithes.

               <head>That S. Hierom was of the minde that there ought to be one chiefe biſhop in Chriſtes churche. <note place="margin">Dialog. aduerſus Lucifer.</note> The 13. Chapter.</head>
               <p>Yow graunt M. Nowell, that ſaint Cyprian and ſaint Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome <note place="margin">fol. 30. b. 23. fol. 40. a. 1.</note> were bothe of one minde. Therefore ſaie I, they bothe proue the neceſsitie of one heade. Neither care I whether S. Hierome ſpeake in this dialogue of the B. of Rome by name or no. It ſuffiſeth to proue my entent, that as by youre owne confeſſion S. Cypriah is of the minde that in euerye dioceſſe there muſt be one prieſte and iudge in the ſtede of Chriſte whome all the reſt muſt obeye: ſo S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome alſo is of the ſame. The which being once graunted, it foloweth verie well, that ſeing for one litle dioceſſe, a he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade ouer ſo meane men as pariſhe prieſtes be, is preciſely neceſſarie, muche more is a heade in earthe ouer all the biſhoppes which haue euerie one of them ſo greate power ouer their owne flocke (leſt theye abuſe the ſame) of gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more forcible neceſsitie. And therefore you take greate paines to no purpoſe, to proue that S. Hierome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aketh not of the B. of Rome, but of euery other biſhop, the which thinge I woulde hier you to proue for me. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas if he had ſpoken of the B. of Rome by name, it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne a reaſon grounded vpon the auctoritie of <hi>S.</hi> Hierome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17023:73"/> now being ſpoken of euerie biſhop, it confirmeth by reconing the neceſsitie of one heade particulerly in euerye dioceſſe, the greate neceſsitie of the ſame one heade in the whole bodie of the churche by naturall reaſon alſo, which proueth my purpoſe better then any priuate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie can doe. If cancred malice, and deſire to be reuenged had not caried yow ſo far and faſt awaye, that it gaue you no leiſor to loke backe to the title of the argument that is here handled, youre ſelfe woulde ſone haue perceiued ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we litle it were neceſſarie, to haue in this place anie ſpeciall mention made of the B. of Rome.

For all thoughe there be no one wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de there ſpeciall to the B. of Rome, as it is not neceſſary that there be: how ſhoulde yeat this auctoritie preſſe him that woulde maintaine the contrary, and ſaye to you: what M. Nowell I thinke your wittes faile you: Maye there not be ſome one worde ſpeciall to the B. of Rome in that dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, becauſe it conteineth manie wholeſome preceptes concerning the life of biſhoppes? Is not the B, of Rome a biſhop? Muche like or more fooliſhe then this, are youre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notes gathered here and there out of this dialogue to proue that which you ſaie of euerye biſhoppes auctoritie, and to reproue my wreſting as you terme it of this place to the auctority of one biſhop ouer the whole church. For who ſence reaſon was firſt poured in to mannes heade, harde euer of one that occupieth the place of a wiſe man, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb facs="tcp:17023:74"/> foliſhe or braineſicke kinde of reaſoning then is this: S. Hierome ſpeaketh in diuerſe places of this dialogue of manye biſhoppes, becauſe the queſtion was whether biſhoppes retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from their hereſies ſhoulde be vnbiſhopped or no, before they were reconciled. Ergo, He meant not in the place alleaged that there ſhoulder be one chiefe biſſhoppe in the churche. This ſemed to your ſelf to be farre from the marke I doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te not, when you promiſe to come nearer to the place by <note place="margin">fol. 40. b. 22. fol. 41. b.</note> me alleaged. And therefore you bring in certeine ſentences going next before, to proue that which I denie not, that S. Hierome ſpeaketh of euery biſhop in his owne dioceſſe. And thereupon you conclude.</p>
               <p>And therefore this whole matter is altogether impertinent to <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 42. b. 9</note> D. Harding and M. Dormans purpoſe of one onelye heade ouer the whole churche. Vnleſſe M. Dorman woulde frame vs thereof this lewde argument. S. Hierome ſaieth that euery biſhop ought to haue auctoritie aboue all other prieſtes of his owne dioceſſe: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the B. of Rome ought to haue a preeminence peereleſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all biſhoppes of all dioceſſes, and ouer the whole church thorough out the whole worlde.</p>
               <p>No M. Nowell I will not reaſon ſo in this place, becauſe <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> the argument whiche I handle forceth me not ſo to doe. But if I had ſo reaſoned or woulde ſo reaſon, as yow thinke no man being awake wil: yeat am I he, that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in my ſlepe M. Nowell were able to defende that argument againſte yow, ſtaring with bothe youre eyes wide open vpon me. And that youre ſelfe perceiued well inough, and therefore like a tendre harted ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as lothe to breake my ſweete ſlepe, you ſtolle from it as ſoftlye as you might. For this being, I praye you firſt graunted, that euery biſhop ought to haue auctoritie aboue all other prieſtes of his owne dioceſſe, and the reaſon being (as <hi>S.</hi> Hierome hathe here, and you in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the argument guilefully left out) <hi>for the auoiding of ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes:</hi> I woulde infer for the <hi>minor</hi> or ſeconde propoſition:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17023:74"/> but the ſame reaſon (for the auoiding of ſchiſmes) dothe no leſſe, yea more enforce that one haue pereleſſe auctoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the biſhops and prieſtes of the whole world. Ergo, there muſt be one ſuche heade, and that by a conſequent the B. of Rome, who hathe euer ſo bene reputed and taken, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you by youre deanely auctoritie haue power to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſome other. But I brought not S. Hieromes aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie <note place="margin">VVhy S. Hierome was firſt alleaged.</note> M. Nowell to conclude ſo particulerly, or to force it to the B. of Romes ſupremacy, but only to proue the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie of one generall heade ouer Chriſtes vniuerſal chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, the which no reaſonable man can denie but that moſt effectually it dooth. So that nowe youre greate muſing at any man that ſhall to this ſenſe alleage this place of S.

               <p>If it had pleaſed yow ſo to haue taken <hi>S.</hi> Hierome, he <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> might haue ment that the name of a prieſte, and the name of a biſhop was all one in the vſe of ſpeche, in the holie ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and in the ſacrament of ordres, but not in dignitie, preeminence and auctoritie. For a biſhop is preferred befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re a prieſte in iuriſdiction, allthough their names were once confounded. Neither are all thoſe thinges by and by to be confounded as one in truthe and nature, the names where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be confounded. Otherwiſe becauſe the Apoſtles are in the goſpell called diſciples, an Apoſtle and a diſciple are all one, which is well knowen not to be ſo. Likewiſe though
<pb facs="tcp:17023:75"/> the termes of prieſte and biſhop were common, yeat the thinges were neuer one: in ſo muche that S. Auſten ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mention of the hereſie of Aerius ſaieth, <hi>Dicebat etiam praesbiterum ab epiſcopo nulla differentia ſecerni debere.</hi> He ſaide <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad quod vult Deum haereſ.</hi> 57.</note> alſo that a prieſte ought to be diſtinguiſhed from a biſhop by no difference.</p>
               <p>But what meane you here M. Nowell to talcke ſo much of the equalitie of biſhoppes and prieſtes, being a matter in this place nothing to oure purpoſe? Or if it were, ſeing it might be ſaide, that euen as the olde canons (as I declared before) in that equalitie which is in prieſtehode, vſed yeat <note place="margin">In the 6. chapitre. fol. 33. b.</note> the worde <hi>Archipraeſbiter,</hi> chiefe prieſte, and ordeined ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che a dignitie in the churche: ſo there is nothing that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, why in the equalitie of biſhoppes and prieſtes, while no one is more biſhop or prieſte then an other, there maie <note place="margin">How one biſhop is equall to an other.</note> not be degrees notwithſtanding of ſuperioritie, allthough not in the ſacrament of ordres, which is common to them all, yeat in the execution of that power that is conferred thereby. But perhappes you be of the opinion youre ſelfe that there ought to be no difference betwene a biſhop and a prieſte, and therefore are the gladder to ſnatche occaſion by all meanes, direct or indirect, to vtter youre minde ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Nowe foloweth vpon this grounde laied, that biſhoppes and prieſtes be by the firſt inſtitution and the lawe of God one, youre concluſion: whereby you will make it appeare, that you haue not without cauſe made mention of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie of biſhoppes, and prieſtes.</p>
               <p>So that all biſhoppes, which be the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles, <note place="margin">Nowell. b. 24.</note> be alſo <hi>praeſbiteri,</hi> that is to ſaie elders or prieſtes. Whereof it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth alſo, that there is an equalitie emongeſt all biſhoppes by goddes lawe, as the equall ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles. And that this is S.

But let it be graunted vnto you that the apoſtles were equal, yeat ſhall not your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion folow for all that. For it is to be conſidered that in the Apoſtles there is a double reſpect which is to be weighed
<pb facs="tcp:17023:76"/> nowe of vs. Either we conſidre them as they were all Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, or as they were biſhoppes. As they were Apoſtles they <note place="margin">How the Apoſtles were all equall.</note> were all equall, they had all like power to preache and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thorough out the whole worlde. As they were biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes and rulers of particuler churches, they were all ſubiect to Petre the chiefe biſhop of all. As they were Apoſtles, that is to ſaye generall legates, to plante Chriſtes faithe thorough out all the world, to founde churchs, to preach the word of God, finally to gouerne vniuerſally in all places where their ſhould come, they tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſmitted this right none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their ſucceſſours, but only Peter: who was the generall ſhepherd of all. Which is the cauſe that ſome of the fathers (namely S. Auſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaie, that the power giuen to Peter was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In pſalm.</hi> 208.</note> in the perſone of the church, becauſe it was not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him alone, but to all his ſucceſſours to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue for euer. As the A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſtles were biſhops of particuler places their auctoritie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not with them, but we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t further to the whole church to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue for euer. Now to applye this to our purpoſe, howe doe the biſhoppes that now are ſuccede the Apoſtles? They ſuccede them as biſhoppes, not as Apoſtles. For if they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded them ſo, who ſeeth not that as the Apoſtles made la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, abſolued, excommunicated and ruled thorough out all <note place="margin">How biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes be the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſours of the Apoſtles.</note> the worlde where ſo euer they came, ſo might the biſhoppes that nowe ſuccede the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe the like. The which thing ſeing we finde by no recordes ſith the apoſtles time that euer it was practiſed in the church, and if it ſhould, it were the nex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te waie to diſquiet al the worlde, and to fill the churche full of ſchiſmes and hereſies, reaſon it ſelfe dothe conuince, that the ordre taken emongeſt the Apoſtles was but by ſpeciall priuileage, not appointed to continue for euer, or to dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate anie thing from the generall ordre begonne in Peter, and appointed to be perpetuall as long as the church ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17023:76"/> endure. To conclude therfore, I graunte to you M. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well that the Apoſtles were equall as they were all the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall legates of Chriſte, but not as they had their ſpeciall biſhoprikes and charges limited vnto them. In which latter ſenſe becauſe the biſhoppes that are nowe, ſuccede the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, in which pointe they were not equall, it foloweth againſt you that all biſhoppes be not equall.

Hetherto the wordes off S. Hierome. Of the which maye be concluded: Firſte, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this ordre to haue one heade in Chriſtes churche is no ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall ordre and policie, but an ordre appointed by Chriſtes owne mouthe to begin in his bleſſed Apoſtles: in whome if this gouernement were neceſſary for the auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſchiſmes, howe muche more neceſſary it is emon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt vs, I leaue to the learned and wiſe to iudge. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion that I gather vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this place, is, that here <hi>S.</hi> Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me teacheth vs, that this common obiection of the hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, that Chriſt gaue power of loſing and binding to al in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, and that therfore Peter had no more premine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce then the reſt, is a naughty and vntrue reaſon, as appeareth by theſe wordes of S. Hierome, <hi>tamen</hi> etcae. yeat one is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> choſen etc. Thirdly I gather, that ſeing the apoſtles were
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17023:78"/> biſhoppes, this <hi>Maxime</hi> of youres is cleane ouerthrowen, that all biſhoppes be equall, and that no one hathe anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ouer him: ſeing the Apoſtles being biſhoppes had Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be their heade. Fourthly I note, that this confeſsion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> was wroong as it were by violence from S. Hierome, by the force of his aduerſarie his reaſon. Which being that prieſtes might marie, ſeing Peter the heade of the Apoſtles was maried: it had bene for S. Hierome his vantage to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue denyed that he was heade of them, to haue ſayde as yow doe, that they were all equall, and no one aboue the other. And ſo woulde he we maie be ſuer, being ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and learned an aduerſary as he was, if it had not bene ſo manifeſt a truthe, that it coulde be no more denied, then that Peter was maried. His qualifieng of the place here, that the churche was in an other place builded vpon all, maie giue vs to vnderſtande what he woulde quickly haue done, if Chriſte had not for all that, ſpecially made Peter the heade.

               <p>To this place of S. Hierome I will adde one other, to ſhewe that yow abuſe his auctoritie to muche in labouring
<pb facs="tcp:17023:79"/> to founde vpon him this vntrue propoſition of youres, that not by goddes lawe but by mannes, this ordre of one heade in Chriſtes Churche ſhoulde be eſtabliſhed.

Doe yow not ſee M. Nowell the neceſsitie of one heade, <hi>that vnder one ſhepherd the faithe maye be one.</hi> Heare yow not that it is not mannes deuiſe that it be ſo, but Chriſtes owne ordinaunce? Haue you not with all S. Hierome expounding (as it were) the wordes of S. Cyprian: <hi>tamen vt vnitatem manifeſtaret, vnitatis eiuſdem ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem</hi>

               </p>
               <p>By this it appeareth, that S.

<pb facs="tcp:17023:80"/> churchs began to ſee the neceſsitie of one head ouer euerie churche, according to the patern wherein Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Peter to be the chiefe head of all.

But af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter that euery one thought thoſe that he baptized to be his and not Chriſtes: it was thorough out all the worlde decreed, that one being choſen out of the prieſtes, ſhoulde be ſet ouer the reſt, to whome all the care of the churche ſhould belong, and the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſchiſmes be taken away.</hi> Thus farre <hi>S.</hi> Hierom. By which words as it ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peareth, that the ſchiſmes were in particuler churches, ſo the heades of whome he ſpeaketh, were afterwarde by his min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de choſen in particuler churches. Thus is S.

               <p>This which was thus done afterwarde ſaieth S. Hierome, was done rather for the honour of prieſtehod then for the neceſſitie of <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 43. b. 4</note> the lawe. For by the lawe of God which is firſt, the prieſte (as S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rome ſaieth (may doe aſmuche excepting ordering only, as maye the biſhop: but afterwarde for ordre, one was placed in the higheſt place for the auoiding of ſchiſmes. And if a prieſte by S. Hieromes minde may doe as muche as a biſhop, I thinke alſo one biſhop may by goddes lawe doe as muche as an other biſhop.</p>
               <p>Beholde here (good reader) in M. Nowell a ſinguler <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> pointe of falſe and vntrue dealing, which although it be with him in this booke of his, and other his companions in their other doinges, a thing verie common, and therfore
<pb facs="tcp:17023:80"/> the leſſe to be merueiled at: yeat ſurelie is it in the wreſting of this place of <hi>S.</hi> Hierome of all other moſte euident to be perceiued. For whereas S. Hierome in his Dialogues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Luciferians, hath, that this ordre in the churche, (that the biſhop confirmeth thoſe that are Chriſtened not the prieſte), <hi>was taken rather for the honour of prieſtehode then for the neceſsitie of the lawe.</hi> M. Nowell to make the matter <note place="margin">S. Hierom beelied by M.

Hierome to Eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius, where in expreſſe wordes he hathe, that the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one to rule and gouerne the reſt, was to be a remedie againſt ſchiſmes. For the better vnderſtanding of this falſe dealing of his, I ſhall wiſhe thoſe that either haue not the worckes of S. Hierome at hande, or if they haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande not them in Latine, or if they doe, can not ſo eaſelie turne to the place, to conſidre them as they folowe here in this place: <hi>Quôd ſi hoc loco quaeris quare in eccleſia baptizatus niſi per manus epiſcopi, non accipiat ſpiritum ſanctum, quem nos aſſerimus in vero baptiſmate tribui: diſce hanc obſeruationem ex ea authoritate deſcendere, quod poſt aſcenſum domini ſpiritus</hi>

But if in this place thow aſke of me wherfore he that is baptiſed in the church dothe not receiue the holie ghoſt but byt he handes of the biſſhop, the which holye ghoſt we doe all affirme to be giuen in true baptiſme? Learne this obſeruation to come
<pb facs="tcp:17023:81"/> of that auctoritie, that after the aſcenſion of oure lorde the holie ghoſt came downe to the Apoſtles. And we finde that the ſame is done in manie places, rather for the honour of prieſtehode, then of neceſſitie of the lawe. Els if the holie ghoſt come downe only at the praier of the biſhop, they are to be lamented who being baptiſed by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtes and deacons in litle townes or villages, or places fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of, doe dye before they be viſited by the biſhoppes. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the wordes of S. Hierome. Nexte after the whiche becauſe it foloweth, <hi>that the high prieſte muſt haue auctoritie peereleſſe aboue all other, otherwiſe that there will be as manie ſchiſmes in the churche as there be prieſtes,</hi> M. Nowell thinketh that he might vnderſtand, both the peereleſſe auctoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other that is mentioned in the dialogue againſt the Luciferians, and the preeminence that one had giuen to rule the reſt as for a remedye againſt ſchiſmes, ſpoken off in this epiſtle to Euagrius, to be ment of onely power to confirme children or other lately baptiſed, which becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe biſhoppes had, and prieſtes had not, he thinketh S.

               <p>But nowe I praye yow let me aſke of you M. Nowell, when S. Hierome had ſaide, that this obſeruation that the biſhop ſhoulde confirme and not the prieſte, came of this that the holie ghoſte after Chriſtes aſcenſion came downe to the Apoſtles, when he added. <hi>Et multis in locis idem facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatum reperimus, &amp;c.

               <p>One thing I muſt here tell you by the waie M. Nowell, <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> that in debating this matter of the auctoritie of S.

And therfore if you will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be tried by S. Hierome, he ſhoulde rather holde with this ſupremacie, as the man who if he erred in ſtriuing with S. Auſten about this reprehending of Peter, erred onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought it a thing vnſemely and vnlikely, that S. Paule woulde ſo reprehende the prince of the Apoſtles. Which was he ſaieth the cauſe, why Origen and other to ſtoppe the mouthe of Porphirius the heretike, who laied to S.

               <p>But leauing S. Hierome, and graunting that Peter was truly and in deede reprehended by S.

But now let vs here you propoſe the firſt, for the which you haue laied as a fundation to leane vnto, ſo notable a lie.</p>
               <p>The firſt exception againſt this teſtimonie of Leo is this: <note place="margin">Nowell. b. 13.</note> No man maie be witneſſe in his owne cauſe nor iudge. Therefore Leo his teſtimonie brought furthe for the preeminence of his own See is not to be admitted &amp;c. This exception of youres yow proue by reaſon, by ſcripture, by lawe.</p>
               <p>Firſt to anſwere youre reaſon if reaſon theire maie be in <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> anie ſo vncharitable a iudgement: I ſaie it is falſe that the holieſt and beſt men be lightly partiall in their owne mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. He is neither holie nor good, much leſſe to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongeſt the holieſt and beſt, that for the bettring off his owne cauſe will ſwarue from the truthe. Youre teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie alleaged out of the ghoſpell is not to the purpoſe. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 5.</note> For that place proueth not, that allwaies the teſtimonie that a man giueth of himſelfe is falſe, but that when a man hath to doe with aduerſaries that will not otherwiſe beleue him, as the Phariſeis woulde not Chriſt, then he muſt vſe the teſtimonie of other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelfe. Which as Leo in ſuch

If yow will ſaie, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the auctoritie of the pope bring Leo againſt yow which are the aduerſaries, and that therefore nowe becawſe you are againſt Chriſtes vicair, as the Phariſeis were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſte him ſelfe (for ſo doe yow confeſſe that you <note place="margin">M.

For to anſwere you who diſpute ſo depely oute of the lawe like one that is not alltogether ignorant therein, <hi>concluſum eſt in cauſa</hi> M.

For other men who haue not atteined to ſuch knowledge, I ſaie: that ſeing in Leo his time when he appointed in this epiſtle the biſhop of <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica</hi> in his ſteade thorough out <hi>Grecia,</hi> and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries adioining, in an other place the B. of Orleance or ſome other thorough out Fraunce, <hi>Hormiſdas</hi> biſhop of <hi>Hiſpalis</hi> to be his vicair in Spaine, the churches that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were and in to whoſe power the churches of this time ſuccede, excepted nothing againſt theſe doinges of his in his owne cauſe as you ſurmiſe, but ſuffered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to paſſe till our time, the ſpace of 1100. yeares and odde: I anſwere I ſaye for replie to youre exception, that had this teſtimonie bene (being vrged by the rigour of the lawe) inſufficient, that yeat foraſmoche as
<pb facs="tcp:17023:88"/> the churche from that time hetherto accepted it for ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, you come now to late to propoſe matter againſt it. To make the matter by example more plaine: if my aunceſtor a hundred yeares paſt in a contention betwene him and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me other aboute a piece of landes, woulde vpon truſt of the vpright conſcience of ſome neare kinſman of his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, admit him to be a witneſſe or iudge in the matter whome he might laufullie repell: might I if ſentence were giuen againſt my aunceſtor by the meanes of this iudge or witneſſe, come after the 100. yeares and excepte againſt the witneſſe or iudge? Leo ſpeaketh not nowe M. Nowell, he gaue this teſtimonie that the giueth 1100. yeares agoe. The whole churche iuſtified his perſone then, to be bothe holie and bleſſed. It is to late and to muche ſhame alſo for yow to ſtarte vp now and ſaye the contrary.</p>
               <p>Thus muche might be ſaied if it were true that Leo had bene witneſſe or iudge in his own cauſe. But the truthe is, it is not his cauſe, it is the cauſe of Chriſtes church and of the whole ordre of prieſthod.

               <p>Pighius was neuer of that minde that you would haue him ſeme to be.

               <p>I forbare to alleage (I confeſſe ſo muche) in one place off <note place="margin">a, 28.</note> my boke, the notable teſtimonies of <hi>Clemens, Anacletus, Euariſtus, Alexander, Xiſtus, Teleſphorus, Pius, Victor, Fabia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and ſuche other, onely becauſe the gaineſaiers might happelie haue excepted againſt them, that becauſe they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re biſhoppes of Rome they were not in that cauſe which was there owne, indifferent witneſſes. How ſaye you M. Nowell what gather you hereof? That you might laufullye take exception to them as not indifferent? If you gather ſo you wrangle with me. My wordes that went before, in whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che to iuſtifie their perſones and to ſhewe how vnlaufullie you ſhoulde doe it, I called them martirs and in the whole courſe of their liues verie apoſtles, doe witneſſe with me the contrarie. Yeat ſaide I that you might doe it, <hi>de facto</hi> not <hi>de iure,</hi> as you maie kill a man in dede but not by lawe. As faſt as you ſaie I laied on loade of not onelie popiſhe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, but popes them ſelues: for popes I thinke it will be harde for you to name but one beſide <hi>Leo, Innocentius</hi> and Gregorie the firſt, whoſe ſainges I alleaged. And why I
<pb facs="tcp:17023:89"/> brought thoſe rather then other I ſhowed good cauſe. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie not yeat for all that, but that euen this onely Leo I thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke is a heauier loade then yow woulde be gladde to beare. That I yealded ſo muche at that time as to omit the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of thoſe notable popes. I repent me therof. By po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhe witneſſes you can meane no other but the fathers off Chriſtes church, and thoſe to within the firſt ſix hundred yeares, for other I alleaged none.

               <p>As before for the fundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this your firſt exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you laied a falſe ſclaunderouſe lye to builde vpon: ſo now to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derprop the ſame, vnder the colour off a more reaſonable cauſe of exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you bring in a feined ſtory of Sozimus biſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome, who (you ſaie,) did falſefie the decrees of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cene councel, whereupon you will conclude, that neither Leo <note place="margin">b. 3.</note> nor anye other pope neither, is to be beleued in this matter. Not vnlike to the fooliſhe gentle woman that ſware ſhe woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de neuer loue oure Ladie more, becauſe ſhe was a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we borne and the Iewes had put Chriſte to deathe.

But becauſe it is here impertinently entermedled with the anſwere to Leo, I will firſt to auoide confuſion ende that matter, and then handle
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17023:89"/> the other by it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Yow ſaye that Pighius affirmeth and I denye, that the title <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 48. a. 9</note> off oecumenicall or vniuerſall Patriarke apperteineth to the biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome of right, and that therefore there muſt nedes be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me erroure.</p>
               <p>You report vntrulye of me M. Nowell. Loke better v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> the place. I reherſe there the wordes of S. Gregorye who reprehended Iohn the B. of Conſtantinople for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on him the name of vniuerſall biſhop. Which title al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it perteined to that Iohn in no ſenſe, and was as he affected it a prophane title and altogether mete for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt: yeat in that ſenſe and meaning that it belonged to S. Gregorie (in which ſenſe onelye it is to be taken when it is applyed to the biſhop of Rome) I denied it not to pertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to the pope. Thus doe Pighius and I agree. Thus is there no errour: thus goe you forwarde to encreaſe the numbre <note place="margin">Lye. 33.</note> of youre lyes.</p>
               <p>Yow merueile greatly that Leo woulde ſo ambitiouſly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge <note place="margin">Nowell. a. 14.</note> in this epiſtle the ſame title in effect which he refuſed ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offred vnto him by the whole councell &amp;c.</p>
               <p>LEO, Gregorie after him, Pius whiche is nowe, nor <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> anye pope that euer was before did ſtriue about titles yow maye be ſuer. The beſt title that they haue eche off them, hathe bene and is, to be called <hi>Seruus ſeruorum Dei,</hi> the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt of the Seruauntes of God.

The pope claimeth not this title, no more then Leo dyd accepte it being offred. Calle him by what ſobre honeſte name you liſt: Graunte him the auctoritie due to him, let all titles goe. This is that whiche the pope claimeth and you ought not to denie. This is that whiche Leo moſt modeſtly, not as yow falſelye terme it (ambitiouſly) cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged to Peters ſeate. Nowe let all reaſonable men iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge hardely of the goodneſſe of this exception, whiche is <note place="margin">a. 24.</note> youre firſt.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde exception that you vſe againſt this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Leo (for now yow ſaie yow will goe an other waye <note place="margin">Nowell. a. 28.</note> to worke with me) is, that Leo ſaieth here vntruelye (if theſe be Leo his wordes, for that yow ſaye is yeat in controuerſie). But before you proue it, yow will firſt aſke me a queſtion, whether I haue trulye tranſlated the place, and iff I haue, howe I can make theſe wordes in this epiſtle, <hi>there is one dignitie common to all biſhoppes,</hi> to agree with theſe folowing, <hi>there is difference of power emongeſt them,</hi> and, <hi>it is giuen to one to be aboue all the reste whoſe iudgement is of moſte auctoritie,</hi>

But I merueile why you ſhoulde put anie doubtes whether theſe be Leo his wordes or no, ſeing that Caluin confeſſeth this epiſtle to be true and to be his. To youre firſt queſtion I anſwere, that I haue tranſlated this place trulye according to the copie printed at Colein anno 1561. To the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vpon this, how then I can make theſe wordes agree, <hi>one dignitie common to all, and difference of power,</hi> that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree thus, that allthough they haue all one dignitie of prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtehode or biſhoprike, that yeat there is difference of power in iuriſdiction. If ſpirituall examples like yow not: if you can not perceiue this agrement at home in youre owne chapitre, where being all equall in the dignitie of canons or prebendaries, yeat one deane, him ſelfe alſo a canon and in that reſpecte equall to the reſt, is aboue the other in power, nor in youre prouince of Cauntorburie where all the biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes equall in that dignitie, are yeat inferiour to the Archebiſhop in power, as youre ſelfe ſome times graunte, namelie before fol. 32. a. where you vſe the worde <hi>chiefe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of euerie prouince:</hi> yeat take the paines to make a ſtep to weſtminſtre hall, where when yow beholde the honorable iudges ſitting in their places, although they beequall in this dignitie that they be all the Quenes iudges, yeat is there you can not denie difference of power emongeſt them.

To whome after he had made a verie ſhorte but pithy oration, to this effect to ſhewe mercy to the citie off Rome, the cruell monſtre without anie furder hurte doing

               <p>Yow ſaye that he diſſentith firſt from S. Cyprian, and next <note place="margin">Nowell. fo. 49. a. 23</note> from S Hierome. From S.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17023:92"/> AB VNITATE PROFICISCITVR VT ECCLESIA VNA MONSTRETVR. That is to ſaye: And although oure Lorde gaue like power to all his apoſtles after his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and ſaide: As my father ſent me, ſo ſende I you. Take you the holie ghoſt, whoſe ſynnes you forgiue they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, whoſe ſinnes you reteine they are reteined: yeat to ſet furthe vnitie he diſpoſed by his auctoritie, the ſame vnitie to beginne of one. That were trulie the other apoſtles alſo that Peter was, indued with like felowſhip of honour and power, but the beginning commeth from vnitie, that the churche maie be declared to be one. Theſe be the wordes of S. Ciprian faithfullie alleaged and trulie engliſhed. I will now repeate the matter euen from the beginning and doe you good Readers to vnderſtande, the cauſe why S. Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mentioneth here at all <hi>S.</hi> Peter, and why he entreth in to this compariſon betwene him and the other apoſtles, and then after make you priuey to the miſteries of M. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welles ſleight in alleaging this place, which he perhappes thinketh that no man knoweth but him ſelfe, and woulde I dare ſaie be lothe that anie mo ſhoulde. For the firſt it is to be vnderſtande, that not manie lines before this place that I haue nowe in hande, S. Cyprian complaining of the fraude and ſubtilite of oure enemie the diuel, ſaith, that now that idolles be euerie where deſtroied, he hath bethought him of a newe waie to deceiue mankinde, and that is by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies and ſchiſmes to carie them oute of the churche. <hi>And this commeth to paſse</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>while men come not to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of truthe, the heade is not ſought out, neither the doctrine off oure heauenly maiſter kepte, which thinges if a man woulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidre and examine, there woulde nede no long diſcourſe nor grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te argumentes. The truthe hath made the way to proue the faithe eaſy: Oure Lorde ſaieth to Peter and vpon this rocke will I buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi>

And although after his reſurrection he gaue all his apoſtles like power,</hi> and ſo furthe as I reherſed before. After all this he addeth: <hi>Hanc eccleſiae vnitatem qui non tenet, tenere ſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem credit?</hi> This vnitie of the churche he that holdeth not, thinketh he that he holdeth the faith? Thus farre <hi>S.</hi> Cipria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The occaſion you ſee that moued him to mention Peter, <note place="margin">Note.</note> and to compare him with the other apoſtles, was becauſe to auoide ſchiſmes we muſt he ſaid ſeke out vnitie by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where we ſhoulde finde, that our lord woulde haue his churche to begin of one: of him, to whome he ſaide: <hi>thow art Petre and vpon this rocke will I builde my churche.</hi> Well then muſt this be reteined as a truthe in the meane ſeaſon, if we will be within the vnitie of the churche, we muſt kepe vs in that churche which beginning and ſpringing out of one roote, or flowing out of one heade founteine (for theſe be alſo in this place S. Cyprians ſimilitudes) is one. Now let vs applye the place as it is alleaged by you M. Nowell, and ſee whether you haue vſed S. Cyprian wel or no. You alleage the place to proue ſuch an equalitie emongeſt th' a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles as that there ſhould be no difference emongeſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſo ouerthrowe all S. Cyprians drift whereby he woul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de proue the churche to be one, becauſe it taketh beginnin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of one. For if they be all equall and no difference betwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne them, then either the churche hathe no one beginning or 12. beginninges. If no one beginning, howe can the vnitie procede of that which is not? if 12, how can the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che be therefore one becauſe as S. Cyprian ſaieth the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof beginneth of one, or what beginning call yow that of vnitie, that commeth from ſuche an equall multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie? If therefore it be builded vpon one alone (as by S. Cyprian it appeareth that it muſt) then is that one aboue
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17023:93"/> the reſt. Nowe to haue the churche builded vpon one, is thus muche to ſaye, that as in a materiall building there is one foundation whereupon all the reſt thereof, ſtone, tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre, Iron and what ſo euer elles, leaneth: ſo there is in the churche one, to whome after Chriſte the great rocke and firſte grounde, all the reſt that be membres thereof muſte as it were leane, he him ſelfe bearing the burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le building. Is not this to be the chiefe ſtone in Gods buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? If you ſhoulde here perhappes wrangle, and ſaye that although it appeare by this place, that Chriſte diſpoſed the beginning of vnitie to procede from one, and from Peter toe, that yeat here is no mention that the churche ſhoulde be builded vpon him, notwiſtanding that Chriſte ſpeaking off Peter ſaide he woulde builde it vpon that rocke: then I remit you for the proufe that S.

Againe, the wordes that folowe: <hi>tamen vt vnitatem manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaret, yeat that he might make vnitie knowen,</hi> and, <hi>vt eccleſia v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na monſtretur,</hi> that the churche may be ſhewed to be one: Theſe you paſſed ouer becauſe in them lyeth the very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, why oure Sauioure hath appointed one to be aboue the reſt, for vnities ſake: becauſe otherwiſe it coulde not haue bene choſen, but ſo manie rulers ſo manie faithes, and then where had vnitie bene? Beſide this, the worde <hi>ab vno incipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entem,</hi> beginning of one, lefte alſo quite oute, ouerthroweth that falſe propoſition of youres, that to vnite the churche and make it one in earthe, there neadeth no other heade then Chriſte which is in heauen. Whiche if it had bene ſo, what nede was there that Chriſte ſhoulde appointe a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man to that office, as here it appeareth he did Peter. To this moſte ſhameleſſe mangling and mutilating of this and other lyke places of the fathers vſed by you and youre fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, I ſaye as S.

The corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ghoſpell, and falſe interpretours take that which commeth behinde, and leaue out that which goeth before, partly mindefull, partly craftely corrupting. As they are them ſelues cut from the churche, ſo deuide they the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the place of S.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17023:94"/> Cyprian ſayeth not, that Chriſte gaue like power to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in all reſpectes abſolutely, but determineth particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly wherein this equalitie dothe conſiſt, as in being ſent to preache thorough out all the worlde as Chriſt was ſent by his Father, in power of forgiuing ſinnes. Which power being giuen to them ſtreight vpon Chriſtes reſurrection, and being common to them as they were all the generall legates of Chriſte thorough out the worlde, derogateth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by S. Cyprians minde from that ſpeciall auctoritie that Chriſte departing out of this worlde gaue to Peter to continue. And therefore to ſhewe that this was his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, euen as before S. Hierome after the like equalitie me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And whither ſhould children I pray you haue recourſe for ſuccour but to their mother. He ſaith not that the ſubiecte of one biſhop may not appeale to an other, <note place="margin">Lyes.</note> that is one lie: He ſaieth not that the cauſe determined by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> biſhop may be called before no other, that is an other lie. He maketh no compariſon as you ſay he doth, betwene the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> biſhoppes of Afrike, Italie and Rome, behold the third lye. He ſaieth not that none but a fewe wicked and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> men thinke the auctoritie of one biſhop to be leſſe then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> the auctoritie of an other: which if he ſhoulde youre ſelfe were like by that meanes to be of the nombre of ſuch deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and wicked men, who before acknowledged chiefe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, a worde that preſuppoſeth other that be inferiour, and <note place="margin">fol. 32. 2.</note> be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to him ſelfe, as I proued before by his writing to Steuen the pope, wherby he required him to take ordre by his lettres for the remouing from his biſhoprike, Martianus the B. of Arles, and by that, that him ſelfe ſent to Rome to Cornelius to trie the matter before him with thoſe euill me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that complained vpon him there, by his excepting againſte the ſentence giuen by the pope for the reſtitution of Baſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, for no other cauſe but becauſe it was obteined by falſe information. All which exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples doe not only proue that he was not of the minde that no one biſhop was aboue an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17023:96"/> but this alſo, that the B. of Rome was of greater aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie then the biſhoppes of Fraunce, Spaine, or Afrike.</p>
               <p>Hetherto of the diſagrement betwene S. Ciprian and Leo, which by this time all men, I truſt perceiue to be no ſuche as you vaunted it was, yea to be none at all, but ſuche conſent rather as in diuerſe wordes there can not be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It foloweth that we examine how Hierome and Leo agree.</p>
               <p>S Hierome (yow ſaye) hath, that all churches worſhipping one <note place="margin">Nowell. <hi>fo.</hi> 51. <hi>a.</hi> 10 Borowed out of Caluin <hi>Inst. lib.</hi> 4 <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</note> Chriſte and obſeruing one rule of truthe, are equall with the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of Rome, that all biſhoppes be the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles and of one prieſtehod, and of the ſame merite and dignitie. But Leo ſaieth contrarie, that it was giuen to one to be aboue all the reſt, and that they who be in greater dioceſſes or cities haue more care and auctoritie, and that the onelie ſee of Peter hath charge of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall churche and is heade thereof.</p>
               <p>Yow belye S. Hierome. He ſaieth not that all the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <note place="margin">Dorman. A lye. 38.</note> in the worlde be equall. If he did, he ſhoulde ſaie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to Irinaeus, who ſaieth that the churche of Rome hath <hi>potentiorem principalitatem,</hi> greater ſouereintie then other churches haue: contrary to S. Cipria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who calleth Rome the <note place="margin">

Auſten who calleth it the churche in the which the principalitie of the apoſtolicall ſee hath allwaies flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 162.</note> He ſaieth that Chriſtes church is not diuided, <note n="*" place="margin">Nec alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Romanae vrbis eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, altera totius orbis exiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda.</note> as tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe Rome were one and the whole worlde an other. As for that, that he ſaieth that all biſhoppes be the ſucceſſours off the apoſtles, thoſe wordes make merueilouſly for the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Leo againſt you. For vpon that propoſition of S. Hierome I reaſon thus. All biſhoppes be the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles: but the Apoſtles were not all equal, becauſe as S, Hierom ſaith Peter was their head. Ergo by S. Hieromes, minde all biſhoppes who be their ſucceſſours be not equall,
<pb facs="tcp:17023:97"/> but haue the ſucceſſour of Peter their heade. Againe, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was heade of the Apoſtles, and made becauſe there ſhoulde ariſe no ſchiſme emongeſt them. Ergo the B. off Rome who is Peters ſucceſſour, muſt be heade of his felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we biſhoppes for the ſame cauſe. Theſe two propoſitions, that there was emongeſt the Apoſtles one heade, and that that was Peter, be S. Hieromes owne in his firſt boke againſt Iouinian. The wordes although I reherſed before, yeat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they perteine not onelie to this matter, but to ſhewe alſo how theſe thre, Ciprian, Hierome, and Leo, mete and knit as it were together in this ſentence, that Chriſt appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ouer his church one generall heade: I will recite once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. The wordes therfore of S. Hiero<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Iouinia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be theſe: <hi>At dicis, ſuper Petrum fundatur eccleſia, licet idipſum in alio loco ſuper omnes apoſtolos fiat, &amp; cuncti claues regni coelorum ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiant, &amp; ex aequo ſuper eos eccleſiae fortitudo ſolidetur, tamen propterea inter duodecim vnus eligitur, vt capite conſtituto ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matis tollatur occaſio.</hi> That is to ſaie. But thou ſaieſt: The churche is builded vpon Peter, although the ſame in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place be done vpon all the Apoſtles, and all of them receiue the keyes of heauen, and equallye is the ſtrength of the churche grounded vpon them: yeat for all that is the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re one choſen emongeſt the twelue, that by making a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de emongeſt them occaſion of ſchiſme maye be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye. See yow not nowe by this place of S. Hierome, M. Nowell howe the equalitie of power that S. Cyprian ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, the ſimilitude of honour and equalitie of calling, that Leo remembreth, the building of the churche in one place vpon all the Apoſtles indifferentlie that S. Hierome mentioneth, notwithſtanding: they all three conclude in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne maner (with this worde <hi>tamen,</hi> notwithſtanding) that the churche was builded vpon one, that there was one he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17023:97"/> that there was one preferred before the reſte. This pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of S. Hierome as it vtterly ſtoppeth their mouthes, who reaſon that the Apoſtles were abſolutely in all pointes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall: ſo confirmeth it moſte ſtrongly the anſwere made before to the place of <hi>S.</hi> Ciprian <hi>(that the Apoſtles were all of equall power and auctority)</hi> that that was true at the firſt, but <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 20.</note> that after, oure Lorde (laſt before his aſcenſion) gaue the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 21.</note> chiefe auctoritie to one, in reſpecte as one was choſen from the reſt vpon whome the churche ſhoulde be builded. <hi>S.</hi> Hierome ſaieth that al biſhoppes are of one prieſthode and of the ſame merite: you plaie the falſefier and adde of youre owne, and of the ſame dignitie. The gentlewoman that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <note place="margin">a. 24. S. Hierom falſefied by adding the word (dignitie) whiche is not in him.</note> the Apologie hath preeminence: whiche maketh me to thinke, that you borowed this patche of her, as liking bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be a folower of her falſehoode then of his ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that tranſlating Caluins inſtitutions tranſlated the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce truly.</p>
               <p>Nowe for further anſwere to this place of S. Hierome it is to be vnderſtande, that he ſpeaketh here of the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me which was in Rome, that at the teſtimonie off dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons prieſtes were promoted to ordres. The whiche when he ſaieth, he ſpeaketh not of the B. of Rome him ſelfe and his auctoritie, but of the vſe and cuſtome of that one citie. Nowe is this a thing moſte certeine, that neither dothe the pope requier nor euer did, that all churches ſhoulde folowe the priuate cuſtomes of his churche. And therefore ſaieth S. Hierome, that the cuſtome of the citie of Rome is not the cuſtome of the worlde. Yea in ſuche a caſe if the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me came to be tried, the pope him ſelfe woulde ſaie: <hi>Si au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritas quaeritur, orbis eſt maior vrbe.</hi> If you ſeke to maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne this cuſtome by auctoritie, the worlde is greater then is a citie. Againe where as you woulde perſuade men that all
<pb facs="tcp:17023:98"/> biſhoppes be equall, becauſe S. Hierome ſaieth that they be of equall merite and prieſthode: So were the Apoſtles toe, yeat was one aboue the reſte for all that, as Hierome him ſelfe confeſſeth calling Peter the heade appointed by Chriſte.</p>
               <p>You haue hearde good readers and I truſt in parte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtode, what ſhamefull ſhiftes M. Nowell hathe made, howe buſilie the man hathe beſtirred him ſelfe with falſe additions, wrong tranſlations, hacking, hewing, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring of ſentences, howe he hath ſpared no vilanouſe wordes or impudent lies to deface this vertuouſe and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned father Leo.</p>
               <p>To ſhewe him ſelfe no changling, he concludeth with a concluſion lyke to his premiſſes, that he thinketh that fier and water are not of a more contrarie nature, then are S. <note place="margin">Nowell. a. 31. b. 13.</note> Cyprian and S. Hierome contrarie to this epiſtle alleaged as Leo the popes epiſtle, beſide S. Auguſtine and 200. and mo biſhoppes agreing with them againſt this Leo. He repeteth againe his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, that Leo in his owne cauſe is to be ſuſpected, that it is to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> be doubted whether it be Leo his epiſtle in dede or an others vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> his name, that the wordes of his teſtimonie be eather manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly falſefied, or at the leaſt in diuerſe copies not onelye diuerſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but cleane contrarie. And here his tendre harte coulde not ſuffer him anie longer to refreine him ſelfe, but needes he <note place="margin">fol. 52. a. 2.</note> muſt burſt oute and lament as it were the caſe off the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe and poperie, that is brought nowe to ſuche miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as that being forſaken of all men almoſte learned and graue, it coulde finde no other patrones but ſuche as I am. Allthoughe for that he confeſſeth, that all ſuche as are godly and loue the truthe haue cauſe to thanke almigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie God.</p>
               <p>Howe contrarie Leo is to S. Cyprian and S. Hierome, <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> let the learned iudge: how <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine and the other biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes

Allthough to certifie yow further in the laſt point, albeit reaſon woulde yow ſhoulde haue ſhowed ſome better cauſe of youre doubte then yow haue, leſt by that meanes euerie auctoritie brought againſt yow maie be called in to controuerſie, if it pleaſe yow to doubte therof: I doe note to yow here in the margent other places out of the ſame <note place="margin">

               <p>For the wordes that they be not falſified in this epiſtle, I alleaged before a copie printed at Coleine, which readeth as I doe.

               <p>I am content M.

For allthough <hi>non</hi> being but a little ſillable be notwithſtanding of greate importaunce generallie, yeat here by reaſon of the worde <hi>ordo</hi> which is ambiguouſe, and ſignifieth either a corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and bodie, as we vſe to ſaie the honorable knightes off the ordre, or proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in aray, as when the herauld telleth euerie Lord what ordre he ſhall kepe in their ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or other aſſemblies, where this word is taken in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſignificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and alſo of the word <hi>dignitas</hi> which being in like manner ambiguouſe, ſignifieth either the dignitie of the ſtate of biſhoppes, or ſuperioritie in that ſtate: it maketh
<pb facs="tcp:17023:99"/> no diuerſitie at all. When we reade thus: <hi>Quibus etſi digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas non ſit communiseſt tamen ordo generalis.</hi> To whome all though there be not one dignitie common, yeat is there o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ordre generall: we vnderſtande by this worde (order) the whole order of biſhoppes, emongeſt whome allthough there be diuerſitie of dignities, yeat becauſe biſhoppes, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chebiſhoppes, primates, patriarches, popes, be all biſhoppes, we ſaie: that, that order of being biſhop is common to them all. Likewiſe in this reading we take <hi>dignitas,</hi> for ſuperioritie in that ordre.

We were not blinde you ſee M. Nowell, and I truſt will beare vs witnes. I thinke we ſawe more then yow woulde we ſhoulde haue done. As for my parte, by whoſe taking this cawſe in hande yow iudge that the matter ſhoulde be brought to greate extremitie, I confeſſe (God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) that had I knowen that he had minded to haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten therein who dyd, that I thinke I ſhoulde neuer haue taken pen in hande to haue written, nor when I had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and ended my laboure, and knewe howe muche, how learnedlye had bene ſayde for the defence thereof, ſhould euer haue ſuffered the ſame to goe in to the knowleadge off men, had I not folowed the iudgement off my betters therein. To which good meaning of myne at the firſte, and readie obedience to my ſuperiours at the laſt, ſeing that it hath pleaſed almightie God to giue ſuche ſucceſſe, as that M. Nowell hauing vttred all his eloquence, and ſpent all his other ſtore in awnſwering (of 143. leaues) to one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye 15. hathe not yeat anſwered trulye to 15. wordes: I can

To this maye be added, that to gouerne the whole churche in ſpirituall thinges, how harde and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible a thing ſo euer it ſeme to you, is yeat much more ea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſie to be done then to gouerne the worlde in temporall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, bothe becauſe the buſineſſe and affaires of the worlde are more diuerſe and contrarie then are thoſe of the

               <p>They all, as in their epiſtle to Celeſtine one of the ſucceſſours of this Zozimus appeareth, teſtifie that there was no ſuche matter for the B. of Romes ſuperioritie as was by pope Zozimus allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, neither in their vſuall copies of the Nicene councell, neither in the authenticall examples which were ſent them by Cirill pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarke of Alexandria, and by Atticus patriarke of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: which authenticalles agreing with their owne copies, and all other copies euerie where, had no ſuche thing as Zozimus allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but had the cleane contrarie: for that the 6. and 7. decree off the ſaide Nicene councell, make the patriarkes of Alexandria, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochia, and Hieruſalem equall with the B. of Rome.</p>
               <p>If this be all M. Nowell, then are yow a corrupter and <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> a falſifier of the ſainges of 217. biſhoppes.

                  <hi>biſhop called Vrbanus.</hi> This is a maliciouſe ſurmiſe of youres M. Nowell and hath no grounde.</p>
               <p>Yow ſaie, that Zozimus pretended that it was decreed at <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 46. b. 12.</note> Nice, that the B. of Rome ſhoulde be the chiefe iudge aboue all other biſhoppes, and that it ſhoulde be laufull for anie man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der anie other biſhop, to appeale to the B. of Rome as to the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſt iudge ouer all eccleſiaſticall perſones.</p>
               <p>Yow haue made two lyes at once. For firſt, whereas <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> to make men beleue that the Africanes acknowledged no maner of iuriſdiction in the B. of Rome, yow feine the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of the cawſe betwene the pope and the biſhoppes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> to haue bene, that he pretended a decree of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Nice to be chiefe iudge aboue all other biſhoppes, as though the Africanes had denied that, and not ſtoode ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon this pointe to limite and reſtreine his auctoritie in matters criminall, and cauſes of correction, that is one ſpitefull lie. As to them that conſidre howe in matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">A lye 41.</note> faithe, the Africanes ſubmitted their doinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguſt. epiſt</hi> 90. <hi>Proſper lib. contra Collator. cap.</hi> 41.</note> 
                  <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Celeſtius</hi> the heretikes, to <hi>Innocentius,</hi> and this verie councell to <hi>Zozimus</hi> the popes, by them to be approued: how they required <hi>Innocentius</hi> to cite to Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me <hi>Pelagius</hi> the heretike being then in the Eaſte ſo farre from Rome, it is a thing moſte euident. So that to alleage this facte of the Africanes truly, helpeth nothing youre cauſe at all: as by a familier example of oure owne countrie maie be proued vnto you. It is not vnknowen, that there be ſome places in Englande ſo priuileaged, that for contractes
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17023:103"/> made within thoſe places, they can be called fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence to none of the kinges courtes, yeat ceaſſe they not therefore to be the kinges ſubiectes. Nowe if the Africanes pretended that they were not to be called out of their owne countrie to Rome, for ſuche cauſes as ſeemed to them reaſonable, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely as they them ſelues alleaged, becauſe it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brouſe thing to call witneſſes for euerie thing by daunger of ſea to Rome: yeat woulde they not hereby take awaye his auctoritie, and withdrawe their whole obedience. The ſeconde lye is, that the B. of Rome ſhoulde pretende that it <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil. African cap.</hi> 105. A lie. 42.</note> ſhoulde be laufull for anie man vnder any other biſhop to appeale &amp;c. That this is a lye the epiſtle written by the biſhoppes of <hi>Africa</hi> to <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the pope dothe manifeſtly ſhewe, in the which they making mention them ſelues of ſuch poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes as were conteined in the popes lettres, ſaie, that the thirde was, <hi>de tractandis praesbiterorum &amp; diaconorum cauſis apud finitimos epiſcopos, ſi a ſuis excommunicati perpera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fuerint,</hi> of pleading the cauſes of prieſtes and deacons before the nexte biſhoppes, if they were vniuſtly excommunicate by their owne. Is this nowe ſincere dealing M. Nowell, to ſaie that the pope pretended that any man vnder any other biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop might appeale to him, whereas here appointing the prieſtes and deacons to the biſhoppes of their owne countrie, he releaſeth all ſuche right. But hereoff I ſhall haue anon more occaſion to ſpeake, when I come to that place where you charge the councell of Africa with making a decree, againſt ſailing ouer the ſea with contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies or appellations to the B. of Rome. In the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I will returne to the accuſation put in by you againſt Zoſimus.</p>
               <p>Seing M. Nowell you haue for your parte done what you are hable, to proue Zozimus a falſefier and can not: I will

Therefore excepte you will ſaye that either this epiſtle is feined and not Athanaſius owne (as that is wont in other auctorities brought againſt yow to be youre common and laſt refuge when you be ſore preſſed, which if you doe, you muſt not onelye ſaye it, but proue it alſo): Or that his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie was ſo euill that he coulde not remembre ſo nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a thing ſo latelye before done, or his malice ſo greate that he woulde faine that which neuer was done: you mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte nedes graunte, that this ſixt and ſeuenth canon haue an other meaning then to make the patriarkes of <hi>Alexandria, Antiochia,</hi> and <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> equall with the biſhoppes off
<pb facs="tcp:17023:106"/> Rome. And ſo haue they in dede. For the true meaning of <note place="margin">The true vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding of the 6. and 7. canon of the councel of Nice.</note> them is, to appoint the limites and boundes of thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates iuriſdictions, of whom mention is there made, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome of the biſhop of Rome. As the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des whiche anſwere trulye to the greke and are in Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne theſe, doe wel declare. <hi>Antiqui mores obtineant in Agipto, Libia, &amp; Pentapoli, vt Alexandrinus horum omnium habeat poteſtatem, quia &amp; epiſcopo Romano hoc conſuetum eſt. Similiter etiam per Antiochiam &amp; in caeteris prouincijs priuilegia ſeruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur eccleſijs.</hi> Let olde cuſtomes be kepte in Aegypt, Libia, and Pentapoli, that the B. of <hi>Alexandria</hi> haue the auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ouer them all, for as muche as the B. of Romes maner is ſuche. Semblablye alſo, thorough out Antioche and in other prouinces, let the churches haue their priuileges kepte. Theſe wordes of the councell, as they doe nothing at all diminiſhe the B. of Romes auctoritie, ſo doe they confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me it verie muche. The reaſon of the councell why the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the B. of Alexandria ſhoulde extende ſo far, being (beſide the auncient cuſtome in thoſe partes) the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome alſo of the B. Rome, who it is to be thought vſed of long time ſo to alow it, by conteining in his reſcriptes thoſe prouinces vnder the patriarchie of Alexandria. Which was now brought as an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to confirme and continue the ſame. For this meaning that they ſhould be all equall in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and auctoritie, there is no worde there able to induce. Except a man woulde bring in thoſe graue fathers reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thus fooliſhely: becauſe the B. of Rome hath iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer his owne biſhoprike (for more you giue him not, and the councell nameth no place at all) therfore the B. of Alexandria ſhall haue iuriſdiction ouer all the biſhoppes of Aegipt, Libia, and Pentapoli. Had not this bene thinke you a goodly making of them equall? If you will ſaie that the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17023:106"/> councell ment that the B. of Rome ſhoulde be patriarke in the weſt partes, and therein they ſhoulde be equall, beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de that there be no ſuche wordes in the councell to infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce ſuche a meaning, yeat ſhoulde we of England be neuer the nearer, for oure lot being to be ſtill vnder the biſhop of Rome, all youre laboure were loſt. And againe one chiefe rule of youres ouerthrowen, that all biſhoppes be equall. Which I deſire the learned reader to note dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly. Becauſe yow kepte before M.

Whereas euen this verye councell that you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſelfe bring, by making only three of all the world equall (if that were the meaning of the councell) do the euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerthrowe you. Wel, whether be liker of theſe two ſenſes to be the ſenſe and meaning of the councell, I will leaue to the indifferent and learned to iudge, who I doubte not when they ſhall eaſelie perceiue, that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell attributed ſo much to the auctoritie of the B. of Rome, that his cuſtome was alleaged to proue the iuriſdiction of the B. of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to be as a directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not onelie for that, but alſo for the conſeruing of the priuileges to other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thorougheout <hi>Antiochia</hi> and other prouinces, he will with as like facilitie eſpie, how this ſixt and ſeuenth canon, doe not onelie not diſagree with that alleaged by <hi>Zozimus,</hi> but alſo peaſeably agreing together, the one confirme the other. Thus muche touching theſe canons that you woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de ſo faine haue made co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, without ſhewing the poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes wherein the patriarkes ſhoulde be equal with the B. of Rome) to the other alleaged by <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and after him by <hi>Zozimus.</hi>

               <p>Hauing allreadie ſufficientlie declared, that <hi>Zozimus</hi> is not guiltie of the crime laide to his charge, I wil adde this as for a more confirmation, that <hi>Zozimus</hi> if there had bene <note place="margin">No cauſe way Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimus ſhoulde forge a canon.</note>

                     <hi>Act.</hi> 11.</note> reade, that at Antioche the diſciples were firſt called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and then if S.

               <p>Ells if Ieſus Chriſte be not two but one (as he is moſte cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> one) and being not diuided (as he moſte certeinly is whole) then are yow Ieſuites, were your religion good, nothing ells but Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>It were pitie to interrupte youre paſtime, otherwiſe I <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> woulde put yow in remembraunce that there be no ſuche religiouſe men (as yow fantaſie) called Ieſuites, but then were all the ſporte marred: and therefore let the ſocietye of the name of Ieſus be called for youre pleaſure at this tyme, Ieſuites. And nowe I ſaye to youre obiection, that if yow take Ieſuites preciſely for all that beleue in Ieſus Chriſte, I graunte to yow, Ieſuites and Chriſtians are all one. But they are not called Ieſuites M. Nowell (if they were ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at all) becauſe they beleue in Ieſus Chriſte. So they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued before they were Ieſuites. But why they are called as they are, yow haue hearde before. And thus this argument of youres is proued to be but a ſophiſme, which being thus ouerthrowen, all that yow heape thereupon hereafter, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth downe alſo, as when proceding in this lewde kinde of talcke, yow ſaie.</p>

               <p>But if youre religion be hipocriſie (as it is in dede) then haue yow ſtirred vp an horrible ſchiſme diuiding and cutting the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſe <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> name of Ieſus, in the which onelye is ſaluation: yea tearing Chriſte him ſelfe in pieces, infinitly more wickedly and cruelly, then euer did the wicked ſouldiors that crucified Chriſt, who had a remorſe to cutte his coate a ſondre.</p>

And trulie were it no better, it were but a ſtarc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke lump of hereſies, partly olde newly ſcoured: partly newe lately inuented. Now he commeth to the religion it ſelfe, and vpon a bare ſuppoſition that it is hipocriſy, this luſty Rhetorician diſchargeth a peale of threateninges, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth vpon the ſame, that the profeſſours thereof are a horrible ſchiſme, diuiding, tearing and cutting Chriſte him ſelfe, and ſo furthe. But what if the religion of thoſe whom yow call Ieſuites be no hipocriſy M. Nowell? Yow bid me proue that. On goddes name I ſaie it is no hipocriſye in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. How thinke yow haue I not well and ſubſtantially pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it?

If yow ſaie that yow minded not to proue it but to affirme it, then it ſhalbe inough for me alſo to affirme the contrary onely, without anie nede to proue it at all, attending after youre proufe, that ſo I maie haue ſome matter to anſwere to. Therefore I repeate againe, if the religion that yow ſpeake of be no hipocriſy as it is none in deede, then haue yow malitiouſly lied. When yow ſpeake of cutting the gloriouſe name off Ieſus Chriſte, the tearing of him ſelfe in to pieces, you put vs in remembraunce of that miſerable and moſte horrible tearing that yow haue made of Chriſte, yow cauſe vs to thinke how yow haue cut his miſticall bodye the churche by ſchiſmes and hereſies, how yowe haue haled and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled his ſacramentes, how yow haue rent his true body in that moſte bleſſed ſacrament, how yow haue troden it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your beaſtly feete, infinitly more wickedly and cruelly

<pb facs="tcp:17023:129"/> them, Chriſtes Apoſtles and diſciples forſothe.</p>
               <p>Nowe is not here as I tolde you before a goodly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <note place="margin">Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts deface vnitie.</note> that maketh the Apoſtles and diſciples of Chriſte ſchiſmatikes, that when it can not haue vnitie to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine it, laboureth all that it can to deface it? But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we let vs heare howe he proueth that their ſide ought not to be charged with ſchiſmes and ſectes, becauſe I might as iuſtly (he ſaieth) warne men to credite the auncient phariſeis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Chriſte and his Apoſtles. Why then were there ſectes and ſchiſmes betwene Chriſte and his Apoſtles as there are betwene Luther and his folowers? or agreed the Phariſeis in vnitye of one truth not onely againſt Chriſt and his but emongeſt them ſelues alſo, as we Catholikes doe and euer haue done againſt Luther (whome in this argument M. Nowell yow reſemble to Chriſte and his Apoſtles?) For ſectes and ſchiſmes to be betwene Chriſte and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that yow dare not plainely affirme, but whereas that being the pretence whereby yow woulde defende youre ſchiſmes, that yow ſhoulde haue proued: yow leauing it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnproued, thinke youre ſelfe ſufficiently diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, becauſe the diſciples of Chriſte fell into hereſie. Not doubting but emongeſt the ſimpler ſorte, hereſie being proued within leſſe then two lynes after the mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Apoſtles in the diſciples, they not obſeruing the difference betwene Apoſtles and diſciples, woulde eaſely be deceiued, and beleue that yow had ſufficiently proued the Apoſtles heretikes. For anſwere to this that yow bring here of the diſciples, I ſaye in fewe wordes: that theſe diſciples were not of the Apoſtles, but of ſuche folowers and hearers of Chriſte, as forſooke him before his paſſion, when he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of the bleſſed Sacrament, as it appeareth in the ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. The Apoſtles remained ſtill with Chriſte their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 6.</note>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:17023:129"/> and forſooke him not. Betwene Chriſte and them was moſte perfecte vnitie and agreement. Howe can yow then I praye you, charge Chriſt and his Apoſtles with ſchiſmes, becauſe of the diſciples departing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt? Let vs grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te your imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not otherwiſe vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d reaſon, that Luther were Chriſt and Carolſtadius, Melanchthon, with ſome other his Apoſtles. If this your new Chriſte, and his Apoſtles agreeing all in one faithe, ſome other diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples comming to them ſhoulde reuolt and departe from them againe, were this nowe a iuſt cauſe to call Luther and his companye agreeing all in one, ſchiſmatikes? I thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke yow will not ſaye ſo, at the leaſt there is no reaſon, why ſuche departure ſhoulde preiudicate or hurte them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine quiete ſtill as they did before. If yow will not, nor can not ſaye thus of Luther, why ſaye yow ſo off Chriſte and his Apoſtles? Why ſaye yow that we maye as iuſtlye call them ſchiſmatikes as we doe yow: whereas youre falſe Chriſte and his owne Apoſtles neuer agreed together, and oure true Chriſte with his his neuer diſagreed? And this is the cauſe why we call yow heretikes and ſchiſmatikes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe yow nouriſhe and encreaſſe thoſe hereſies and ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, that ſprong vp euen with youre firſt maiſter and his ſcholers, as youre ſelues can not denie, and departe from Chriſtes knowen churche (or elles Chriſte had no chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che at all) as thoſe diſciples off Chriſte that you ſpeake off did. With whom youre reſemblaunce is ſo muche the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe that as theſe firſt heretikes departed from the church (Chriſte and his Apoſtles) becauſe they would not beleue in Chriſtes doctrine of the bleſſed ſacrament: ſo haue you parted a greate nombre of yow, from vs for the ſame cauſe, and mainteine the ſame hereſie as S. Auguſtine <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In pſalm.</hi> 54.</note> calleth it. Nowe as it were no good reaſon to proue vs
<pb facs="tcp:17023:130"/> ſchiſmatikes, becauſe yow are parted from vs: being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oe as yow can not denye, of vs: ſo can no man iuſtly char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge Chriſte and his Apoſtles with that crime, becauſe his diſciples parted from him. And as I anſwere to this, ſo doe I to youre other obiections of the ſchiſmatikes in S. Paules time, of thoſe other alſo of the Nicolaites, the Simonians, Cerinthians, &amp;c. who all parting from the knowen chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of Chriſte, ought not to preiudicate the ſame. For the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir departure was alwaies ſo ſenſible, that the true chriſtian might ſaye with S. Iohn. <hi>They haue departed from emongeſt</hi>

               <p>Whereas an other plea of youres is, that emongeſt the high prieſtes and Phariſeis there was no diſſention but gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate vnity and concorde emongeſt them againſt Chriſtes Apoſtles: to that I ſaye, that although they agreed in this all to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Apoſtles: yeat emongeſt them ſelues they were <note place="margin">

The Apoſtles were before thoſe ſchiſmes: yowe haue riſen together with the ſchiſmes. Thoſe ſchiſmes departed out from the Apoſtles: your ſchiſmes are within youre ſelues. Againe ſee the agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe ſchiſmes with youres, and confer the caſe of the ſtate of the churche nowe, with that of the primitiue churche then. Thoſe ſchiſmes and ſectes departed out off the primitiue churche: euen ſo haue yow departed nowe oute of the ſame churche being of longre continuance. They being departed multiplied into mo ſchiſmes, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into farder diuiſion, yow being departed multiply daily from ſchiſme to ſchiſme, and newe ſectes haue riſen ſence youre departure from Martin Luther. They troubled and diſquieted the primitiue church of the Apoſtles: yow trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſquiet the catholike churche that nowe is. If you demaunde the prouffe of this which I ſaie, anſwer the boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke (which I am ſuer yow will neuer be hable to anſwere) lately ſet furthe in oure tongue, moſte truly called, <hi>The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſse of the faithe &amp;c.</hi> And ſhewe vs, as you will ſtande to it hereafter, when the faith and light of goddes holy word, which yow ſaie hathe nowe of late ſprong againe, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, where, and by whome.</p>

               <p>This is that whiche I ſaide before, that yow in dede <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> wright diligently one againſt an other, which is a moſte e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident aſſurance of youre diſſention in doctrine. And if theſe youre writinges were in the vulgare tongues to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade of all men, there woulde be no better argument in the worlde to diſgrace youre doctrine for euer.

For your owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, till yow proue vs by Scripture that Chriſtes churche ſhoulde decaie and come to vtter ruine, and that ſo it dyd, yow haue ſayde nothing: againſt vs, till yow bring better matter then different opinions of ſchoolemen in diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matters, of Logiciners aboute the predicables, of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſe men in clothing, diet, going, becking, bowing, &amp;c. yow haue ſayde as little. The firſt ſentence that I prefixed before my booke out of Saint Auguſtine, yow haue not yeat anſwered. If yow had anſwered it there as yow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that you woulde, you ſhoulde not haue neded here to haue troubled either youre ſelfe or the reader with that matter. For anſwere once directly yea or nay to this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yow communicate with all nations, and with thoſe churches founded by the Apoſtles labour, and the matter is anſwered who be the ſchiſmatikes in fewe wordes, you or we. Where you ſaye that my allegations out of S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Baſile, Hierome, Nicephorus, were applyed chiefly to this, to note you of ſchiſmes: I muſte note, that you be here contrarye to youre ſelfe and youre ſainges before. For <note place="margin">M.

And for that cauſe you labour with toothe and naile, to proue that they ought not ſo to be taken.</p>
               <p>Neither are they contented here with, but doe alſo plaie with <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> pictures very pleaſantly as they thinke, in the which they painte out a multitude of ſuche heretikes or rebelles, as oure confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes or allies, whoſe opinions we do moſte abhorre, and againſt whome we continually bothe preache and wrighte.</p>
               <p>Yea forſothe this was the matter in deede, allthough <note place="margin">Dorman.</note>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:17023:134"/> yow be lothe to confeſſe ſo muche, that made yowe to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh out youre ſtore in defence of ſchiſmes and ſectes. It was this table, this arbor as you call it, or crooked tree that made yow to daunce. But what ſaie yow to this tree I praie yow. Yow ſaie, that we haue placed there a multitude of heretikes whoſe opinions yowe doe moſte abhorre. We marueile not though yow like not all, for therein ſtandeth the grace of the table, that of ſo manie ſectes as be there ſet out, no one of them liketh the other. Yowe ſhoulde haue done well to haue named the opinions which yow doe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre, as perhappes yow would, had it not bene for waking ſome of youre felowes that ſeme to be a ſleepe. That theſe ſectes appeare not all of them euidently emongeſt yow, as they doe in Germanie where youre hereſies firſt beganne, <note place="margin">VVhy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes and ſchiſmes ſhewe not them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in Englande as they doe in Germanie</note> as that excuſeth yow not being all membres of that malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant churche youre mother, ſo is it the leſſe to be meruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at, becauſe the ſtates of theſe two countries are not like. England is ruled by one ſouereigne heade, Germanie by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe. Which is the cauſe that the heades being diuerſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in religion, auaunce euery of them that religion whiche liketh him beſt. Whereas in Englande yow lacke that commoditie being vnder the rule of one only heade, whiche is an inuincible argument to ſhewe how neceſſarie in the churche of God it is, to haue one heade to gouerne the reaſt. Had yow in Englande as they haue in Germanie, your free cities, youre dukes, youre Lantgraues, youre Palſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graues, euery one a king within his owne dominions: O how yowre ſectes woulde triumphe in the courtes of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, what combattes they would kepe in open pulpites, that nowe dare not but by ſteal the and in corners, one of them ſnatche and ſnarle at the other. As for youre continuall preaching and writing againſt theſe ſectes, whereof yowe
<pb facs="tcp:17023:135"/> bragge ſo muche, what yow preache againſt the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, Anabaptiſtes, Oſiandrins, or any ſuche like, I reporte me to them which be youre hearers. I thinke what ſo euer face yow ſet vpon it here, yow be colde and rare inough in that argument, and be as plentifull and whot as you will, yow ſhall haue theſe heretikes and ſuche other in places where they dare, ſaie as muche of yowe. As for youre writing, yow proteſtantes at home haue not written anie one worde that is to be ſene abroade againſt anye ſecte of the table, more then in ſome ſely tranſlations of you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re felowes bookes, as yowe terme by contempte that kinde of excerciſe. So buſy yowe are in doing the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of youre father in ſetting furth to the worlde youre Sacramentarie hereſie, and defacing the popes auctoritie, that as little leiſour haue you to wright againſt other ſectes (if yow miſlike them as yow pretende) as yow haue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by preaching, to faſting, to praier, to good worc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. And therefore youre writing I let paſſe as a manifeſt <note place="margin">Lye. 51.</note> lye.</p>
               <p>And all this doe they for that they are not ignorant, that ſuche <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> though moſte falſe ſclaunders, being yeat ſo importunely and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually laied to oure charge, are of muche effect to offende the weake and ſimple, and to ſtirre vp their hatred againſt vs. And therefore they vſe ſuche conſtant aſſeuerations for argumentes, as in their ſchooles they are taught to doe, when they are deſtitute of due prouffes &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If we ſclaunder yow, how eaſy a matter had it bene for <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> yow to haue recouered youre good name, by ſaing: There be not ſo manie ſectes ſprong out of Luther as the table ſaieth there are, and then haue named ſome ſuche as had bene falſely noted in the ſame. The which becauſe yowe haue not done (not for lacke of good will as appeareth.) yow haue verie muche confirmed the truthe of the table.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17023:135"/> Whereas yow ſtande vpon the bare deniall againſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt proufe, yow make vs in deede remembre a ſaing of the ſchooles: <hi>plus poteſt aſinus negare quàm Ariſtoteles probare.</hi> But becauſe this table offendith yow ſo muche, yow maie perchaunce ſhortly haue an other of allmoſte 90. diuerſe ſectes gathered together by the reuerent father WILLIAM <note place="margin">In Dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantio ſuo.</note> LINDAN Biſhop of RVREMVND. But perhappes yow count this a ſclaunder, becauſe yow acknowledge but one religion of Ieſus Chriſt, how manie ſectes ſo euer there be emongeſt yow. For ſo it foloweth.</p>
               <p>For we as we haue no religion but onelye Chriſtes, ſo deſire we <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> to be called after the name of none but his, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Whiche we M. Nowell? For ſo ſaieth euerye ſecte <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> in the table aſwell as yowe ſacramentaries doe. It is not inough for you to ſaye that you haue no religion but the religion of Chriſt, the contrarie whereof neuer he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike durſt yeat in wordes profeſſe. Proue it firſt, then ſaie it afterwardes. Begin from the Apoſtles and come to oure time, and ſhewe youre religion in euery age, as oures hathe <note place="margin">A reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable chalenge to the proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</note> of late bene learnedly ſhewed, and then bragge that you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue none but Chriſtes religion. We offer you faire, refuſe vs not, in goddes name and in the behalfe of his church I ſaie, refuſe vs not. If you dare and miſtruſt not your cauſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure vs libertie freely to ſende in oure bookes, and to other indemnitie for hauing and reading the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is the thing, that (if you meane as you pretende the planting of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the hartes of all men) you ſhoulde moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue deſired: refuſe it not therfore being frely offered. It is the thing, that on youre knees ioyntely together with vs, you ought to become humble petitioners to the Quenes moſte excellent maieſtie to voutcheſaufe to graunte, and
<pb facs="tcp:17023:136"/> to remoue all ſuche occaſions, as might ſtoppe or hinder in anie wiſe the courſe of ſo neceſſarie an attempt. It is the waie to ende all controuerſies, to ceaſſe all ſtriffes, to reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vnitie, to betraye ſchiſmatikes, to make manifeſt the true catholikes, and ſo conſequently to make it appeare, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you haue no religion but only Chriſtes. The whiche ſaing of youres till you proue by this meanes, wil be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no better then a bragge common to all heretikes.</p>
               <p>Thinke they that if we liſt and had leiſor as they haue, we coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> not frame an arbor or tree, twiſe as greate as they haue deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? &amp;c.</p>

It was not my purpoſe here to proue by this place of Deuteron. the biſhop of Rome his ſupremacie ouer Chriſtes whole churche, no more then it is Pighius his in the place by you alleaged.

For the wordes whereupon you grounde youre ſelfe: <hi>And thow ſhalt doe what ſo euer they ſhall ſaye vnto the, who gouerne the place that oure Lorde hathe choſen, and what ſo euer they ſhall teache the according to his Lawe,</hi> as though ſaie you, the prieſte might teache otherwiſe, and then he ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de not be obeyed: be not conditionall, but enunciatiue, that is to ſaye, wordes that expreſſe what he ſhall doe in dede, to aſſure the rather the ignoraunt man to obeye his comma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undement. This interpretation maye manye wayes be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Firſt becauſe it ought to be preſumed, and all men are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> bounde as muche as maye be to indeuour, that the olde tranſlation and the fountaines maye agree together. Which becauſe by this meanes is brought to paſſe, and by that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe whiche you giue in no wiſe it can, it foloweth, that this meaning is rather to be receiued then youres. An other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> cauſe is, the circumſtance of the place it ſelfe, which tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, that the people was bidden goe to the prieſtes, and to the iudge whiche ſhoulde be for the tyme, to aſke hys iudgement of harde and doubtefull queſtions. If euery one of the people had bene hable to finde out in the queſtion that he ſhoulde propoſe to the iudge, what were agreable to Gods lawe and what were not, when the iudge tolde

When ſhoulde thoſe wordes haue bene euer put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that folowe: <hi>He that off pride refuſeth to obeye the prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes commaundement ſhall dye,</hi> if this had bene the meaning that you dreame of? Might not anye man haue wrangled as ofte as he had liſted, that the ſentence was not according to the lawe? And therfore to put the matter out of al doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, the Scripture ſaieth in this verye place, <hi>indicabunt tibi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicij veritatem,</hi> they ſhall tell truthe and giue thee right iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement. To conclude, there is one place in the ſcripture off <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> all other moſte plaine, to couince this ſenſe that the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like doctrine mainteineth. Reade Malachias the prophete the ſecond chapitre, and you ſhall finde, that it was a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt made by God with <hi>Leui,</hi> that his prieſtes ſhoulde <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Malath.</hi> 2.</note> obſerue in iudgementes, truthe and equitye. He pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth that the lippes of the prieſte ſhoulde kepe knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, that the lawe ſhoulde be required at his mouthe, becauſe he is Goddes angell. Can there be anie thing that might more aſſure vs off the meaning of that place then this?</p>
               <p>As for that that you obiect of S. Paule, threatening venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce <note place="margin">fol. 59. b. 14.</note> to the high prieſte, and of S. Peter alſo and S.

For a notable example whereof <hi>Vigilius</hi> the pope maie ſerue vs. Who obteining that ſeate by vnlaufull mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that is to ſaie vpon promiſe made to the Empreſſe to reſtore to the biſhoprike of Conſtantinople <hi>Anthemius,</hi> depriued thereof by <hi>Agapetus</hi> for hereſie: as ſone as euer he entred into that ſeate, the empreſſe chalenging him off his promiſe (ſo was his wicked minde by gods ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence

               <p>Becauſe yow well vnderſtode that all this rouing talcke of youres was wide from the marcke that we ſhoote at, and that happelie ſome one might ſaie vnto you, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which nowe is handled, is whether there ought to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne generall heade in Chriſtes churche or no, and that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore this place was brought in, not to proue who it ſhoulde be, or where he ſhoulde be reſident: yow thought it good to ſaie ſomewhat to this effecte, to proue that this place is vntrulie applied to the proufe of the ſupremacy, of one heade. But howe proue yow this M. Nowell?</p>
               <p>Becauſe S. Cyprian alleageth this and other like places of ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <note place="margin">Nowell. fo. 60. a. 6</note> to make for the ſeuerall auctoritie of euerie peculier

The meaning of S. Cyprian was to perſuade obedience to ſuche prieſtes as haue the charge to rule, to the whiche purpoſe the example of the high prieſte is well applied, if it were for no other cauſe, yeat euen for this, that euerie biſhop is in his owne dioceſſe the high and chiefe prieſte of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that be of the ſame: and no leſſe to be obeied (in that portion of his charge) of thoſe that be vnder him, then he him ſelfe is bounde to obeye the pope, the chiefe and heade in earthe of all biſhoppes.</p>
               <p>It agreeth not (you ſaie) that becauſe the Iues one nation, had <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> one chiefe prieſte, therefore all nations thorough out the worlde ſhoulde haue one high prieſte ouer all other.</p>
               <p>You miſuſe the reader with the terme <hi>(nation).</hi> For not <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> as one nation, but as one Sinagoge, as the onelie churche that then God had, they had one highe prieſte. And ſo all Chriſtians being but one catholike churche though manie nations, ought to haue one heade biſhop ouer all nations. For as for the impoſsibilitie that yeat once againe you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate
<pb facs="tcp:17023:140"/> of hauing one heade, it hathe bene ſufficinetly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned allreadie, that that plea of youres is of no force, and ſo far wide from the truth, that it is not otherwiſe poſsible to haue the church well gouerned and without ſchiſmes, God hauing nowe taken that ordre. Which I ſaye as of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che conſiſting of fraile and ſinfull men. For as touching God, as you ſaie it is poſsible to him to gouerne the church without one heade: ſo ſaye we it is not impoſsible to him, to giue vs one heade to rule the whole, and ſo to direct him that he neuer faile in his decrees, concerning oure faithe. Which becauſe hetherto in dede he hathe done, and beſide hath promiſed that the faithe of Peter ſhall not faile, we ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ye <note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">Nowell. a. 21. b. 28.</note> as for his owne.</p>
               <p>This is no more then you ſaied before, which you ofte <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> repeate to ſeme by ofte ſaing one thing to ſaie ſomewhat. In dede it confirmeth verie muche my anſwere made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For whereas it is manifeſt that this place concerning the obedience due to the high prieſte, is alleaged as well for the auctoritie of Rogatianus who was an inferiour biſhop, as alſo for S. Cyprian the archebiſhop and Metropolitane of Africa, it foloweth, that S. Cyprian in the citing and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging therof had no other meaning, then to perſuade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to euerie biſhop, of what calling ſo euer he were, biſhop, Archebiſhop, primate, patriarke or pope. Excepte you will ſaye that he was of the minde that betwene biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes and Archebiſhoppes he put no difference.</p>
               <p>Yea verilie ſaie you of that minde was S. Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in dede. <note place="margin">Nowell. b. 15.</note> For he confeſſeth in the beginning of his epiſtle to Rogatianus, that he did but of courteſy and not of dutie, refer this matter of

And if theſe two maie ſtande together: Euerie biſhop is the heade and chiefe prieſt of his owne dioceſſe, and yeat there is one archebiſhop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all: then why may not theſe propoſitions ſtande to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Euerie Archebiſhop is chiefe of the prouince where he is Archebiſhop, and yeat there is one pope chiefe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all? <hi>Rogatianus</hi> did here more then he neded: who denieth that? If the B. of London haue in his dioceſſe a ſtubborne and vnruly prieſte, who doubteth but he maie firſt puniſhe him by his owne auctoritie if he liſt? And yeat if he refer
<pb facs="tcp:17023:141"/> the matter to the Archebiſhop of Cauntorburie, he dothe the Archebiſhop more honour, and ſheweth him ſelfe to be the more humble. The Archebiſhop is an eye to ouerſee the biſhop that he doe his dutie, as the pope is to ouerſee all. So long as the biſhop is hable to take ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ordre for all occurre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes in his dioceſſe him ſelfe, if he vſe not this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, but referre it to the Archebiſhop, he dothe more then he nedeth, but yeat honorablie for the Archebiſhoppes parte, and humbly for his owne.</p>
               <p>Where you ſaye, that ſuche by S. Cyprian tranſgreſſe the <note place="margin">Nowell. fo. 61. a. 1.</note> lawe of God in the Deuteronomie, that make them ſelues biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes ouer other biſhoppes. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I haue oftentimes ſhewed here before, that the regiment <note place="margin">Dorman.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:17023:145"/> of the churche is farre different from that of the worlde. It ſhalbe nedeleſſe to repeate it here againe. Yow can not therefore reaſon from the one to the other. Whereof Nazianzene dreamed I knowe not: of this I am ſuer, that to applye by drift of reaſoning the ſentence of an Auctor to that which he neuer ment or inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded (ſo that to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aning and intent it be in no wiſe repugnant or contrarye) is not onely no dreame, but the vſage alſo and practiſe off learned men. And therefore in the lawe, manye a caſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by wordes which the lawier neuer dreamed perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, that they euer ſhoulde be ſo applyed. The better and more excellent the Author is, the more ample ſenſe maye be gathered in his writinges. As in the Scripture eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, the infinite variety of commentaries doth declare.

               <p>For whereas they had but one chiefe biſſhop for their whole <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> nation, he hath prouided for the churche in euery dioceſſe one, that they may be the better gouerned and leſſe pained to trauaile far, for the deciſion of their doubtes and controuerſies.</p>
               <p>To this ſaye we, if God had done no otherwiſe, he had <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> done leſſe for the church then for the Iues. For better it is to haue one heade vnto the whiche doubtes of greate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portaunce maye be referred, then to haue manie in manie places, and euerie one (without reſpect to one chiefe) to doe as he ſhall thinke good. Howe thinke you M.

I know not who gouerneth in your houſe, your wife, or you, or bothe: but this I thinke I maye be bolde to ſaye, that if youre wife were, not quarter maiſter onely, but as muche maiſter as you, that you were not therefore in better caſe then youre nexte neighbour, that had the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le rule of his houſe him ſelfe.

So in the churche M. Nowell, ſeing that as God is one the faithe is alſo one, one heade is better to conſerue that one faithe and the vnitie thereof, then many. Therefore if the Iues had one heade biſhoppe, and the churche diuerſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, it is by all reaſon worſe prouided for. Excepte you will ſaie, that to haue manie equall rulers in one bodie, in one common wealthe, is better then to haue only one. Which notwitſtanding before yow reſembled to their fantaſy, who woulde haue manie equall goddes to rule the worlde. But yow ſaie, there is muche labour and paines ſaued. Here while yow ſeke for eaſe yow leeſe vnitie: while yowe diminiſhe paines, yow prepare the high waie to the multiplieng off ſchiſmes. Yow haue an eye to the reſorting to that one he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade from all places of the worlde, but yow conſidre not the fruite of peace and vnitie that is thereby procured.

               <p>But M. Dorman dealeth not truly with the Apologie &amp;c. The <note place="margin">Nowell. fo. 62. b. 7</note> Apologie ſaieth, that as the church decaied in the olde lawe, where
<pb facs="tcp:17023:147"/> was the ſame God, the ſame Chriſte, the ſame holie ghoſte &amp;c. then as is nowe, ſo maie it and hath it decaied now. M.

               <p>I merueile that yow be not aſhamed to make anie men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Dorman.

One eſpeciall cauſe why this argument of the Apologie, The Synagoge hath decaied; Ergo, the church hath decaied, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded here ſtoutely by M. Nowell, ſhoulde not be good, is, becauſe God hathe made other maner of promiſes for the continuance of his church, then euer he made to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoge.

And yeat if we ſhoulde folowe youre iudgement, the wiſdome of God which came to reforme the olde lawe and make a newe perfecte lawe, ſhould by appointing ouer his churche manie heades for one, make the lawe in that pointe leſſe perfecte then was the other.

               <p>Neither the lawe, neither S. Cyprian vpon the lawe, ſpeaketh againſt one head biſhop. That is an other flat lye M.

But if theſe thinges were in the primitiue churche, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are the people no more I praye you in hande, that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the primitiue church: Iff <hi>S.</hi> Hierome complained of ſuche thinges in his time, then appeale no more to the firſt ſix hundrethe yeares if you be wiſe. Then terme not churche ornamentes late ſuperſtitions. But if S. Hierome complained not at all of ſuche ornamentes of the church, but in the Epiſtle <hi>ad Nepotianum</hi> lamented only that we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ightier matters, as the true decking of Chriſtes churche with good miniſters, were neglected: If in the epiſtle <hi>ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metriadem,</hi> he plainelye ſaieth: <hi>Non reprehendo, non abnuo:</hi> I reproue it not: I diſſent not: then haue you abuſed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ader with S. Hieromes name, and belied him once agayne. That whiche foloweth is but a common place of railing, wherein becauſe you talke but in youre facultie, I can the leſſe blame you. And to reaſon ſadlye with an outragious rayler, were but (you wot well) to preache to frantike Tom of Bedlem.</p>
               <p>The foundation you ſaye, of altars, belles, banners, candels, <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 67. a. 3.</note> &amp;c. leaneth to this reaſon of mine: <hi>It was ſo in the ſhaddowe, therfore it muſt be ſo now in the body, in the truth, in our church:</hi> This reaſon you thinke (you ſaie) that I like as well as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reaſon of one heade, and that reaſon it is that ſo I ſhoulde thinke.</p>
               <p>No M. Nowell, you are fouly deceaued if you write as <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> you thinke. But what? It ſemeth to me that you foregtte
<pb facs="tcp:17023:150"/> yourſelfe. Will you I praye you on high dayes, when you diſtribute thoſe holye miſteries of youres, weare no cope? Or if you doe, muſte the foundation of the wearing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be grounded vppon the Iuiſh ceremonies? No you will anſwere, I weare it becauſe the Quenes Maieſties iniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions will haue me doe ſo. And oure prieſtes weare them becauſe the lawes of the churche will haue them doe ſo. Iff of youre doinges the Princes lawe maye be the grownde: Whie maye not the churche be the ſame of oures? Now if the Prince may commaunde the miniſtre to weare a cope, Why maye not the ſame commaunde the biſhop to weare a mitre, albes and tunicles? Whye maye not by the ſame commaundement, altars, belles, banners, candels, plentie of golde and ſiluer, be brought into the churche? And then if the Prince maye commaunde it, why maye not the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of Chriſte doe as muche? Thus reteine we theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as commaunded by the church, not as vſed by the Iues. Who euer vſeth them ſo is a Iue: who ſo vſeth them ſo, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth deadly. Neither is the reaſon like, why I ſhould reaſon from ceremonies in the lawe, appointed but for the while (as you woulde haue me) to that, by whiche I argue from thinges foreſhadowed in the Synagoge to continue in the church for euer.</p>
               <p>You procede, and (after my maner of reaſoning) you aſke, <note place="margin">Nowell. a. 13.</note> why you maye not alſo reaſon for the ſcriptures to be had in a language that the people do the vnderſtande: For prieſtes to haue wiues, for images to be taken awaye, ſeing that in the Iuiſh chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, all the people, men, women and children, had the ſcripture in a language that they did well vnderſtand, the Leuites and prieſtes had wiues and children, ſeing that in that church there were no I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, eſpeciallie when reaſon beſide the lawe proueth that it ought to be ſo:</p>

                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:17023:150"/> gladlye learne, why my argumente ſhoulde holde and not youres? Liſten a while and you ſhall knowe. Firſte for the Scriptures, I take not here vpon me to reſolue that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether it be expedient that they ſhoulde be in the vulgare tonge or no. For I knowe it is impertinent to oure matter. But to youre queſtion I anſwere, that whereas you ſaie that women and children, had the ſcripture in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that they did well vnderſtand, that is once falſe: for firſte that Hebrue tongue, wherein the ſcriptures were written, was not the common tongue, that the people v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed emongeſt them ſelfes, but ſuche as being peculier to the learned, coulde not beinge vttred by the prieſte be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, excepte he did firſte expounde and interprete it. Nexte beinge writen without pointes, that is without anye vowell at all noted in the texte, as we haue it nowe poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when or by whom it is not certeinlie knowen, but by the learned Iues them ſelues as it is thought, beinge gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together in a councell at a towne called <hi>Tiberia,</hi> it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that the vnlearned, coulde as euill reade it as vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande it beinge readen, till it were expounded. And for this cauſe the 72. elders had onelie power and auctoritie to interprete the ſcripture, and to reade it to the people, as here in the Chapiter by yow alleaged, <hi>Moyſes</hi> dyd. This beinge <note place="margin">

The hebrue tonge I thinke to be holie, for as in the Greke temples there be certeine peculier characters of lettres whiche they call holie: euen ſo the God of all, by Moyſes hathe geuen this tongue, not naturall but apte to teache: for whereas all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do ſpeake the tonge of theire owne nation, wherein they were borne, and they whiche be borne in Italie vſe the Italian tongue, being borne in Grece ſpeake the greke tongue, in Perſia the Perſian, and in Egipte the Egiptian tongue: yet notwithſtandinge none of the children of the Hebrues be founde, whiche from the beginninge vſe the hebrue tongue, but their language emongeſt whom they be borne. Afterwarde when they waxe ſomewhat bigge, they be taughte the caracters and letters, and learne in lettres ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſcripture writen in the Hebrue tongue. Yowe here M. Nowell that the hebrewe tongue wherin the old lawe was written, was no naturall tongue, that the characters and letters were peculiar, that is to ſaie not to be vnderſtande of euery man, and for that cauſe called holy, as thoſe were that the Grekes had in their temples. Yow here that it was not learned by nature as are the Engliſhe, french, Italian and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vulgare tongues, but by arte as are the latine, Greke and Hebrue with vs. So that as the readinge of ſcripture in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine

               <p>For the mariage of prieſtes, why yowe maie not reaſon from the olde lawe to the newe to eſtabliſhe it, the firſte <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> cauſe is, becauſe the prieſtes of the olde lawe did ſerue in the temple by turnes, and when their courſes came to ſerue they were ſeperated from theire wiues.

That this is the true meaning of the place, beſide the auctoritie of theſe fathers, by the whole diſcourſe alſo of the chapitre, and theſe wordes that followe nexte after thoſe alleaged by you, <hi>Vxori vir debitum reddat &amp;c.</hi> Let the man yealde to his wife the due debt of mariage, it maye mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appeare.</p>
               <p>To your laſt queſtion of images, I anſwere, that ſuche images, as Chriſtian men haue, were not forbidden. They were idolles, that were forbidden, or images to be worſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped as God, of which ſorte we haue none. Men doe not ſtoupe to inſenſible blockes or ſtones, no more than he dothe reuerence to wax or parchement, that kiſſeth the Quenes broade ſeale, and therefore that reaſon argueth him, that of men hauing life or reaſon ſo ſaieth or thinketh, to be him ſelfe for his witt a blocke, for his Chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie a verie ſtone. The honour, that we giue to images, is to the thinges that they repreſent, not to the matter of the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>You haue by this time I truſt M. Nowell, your requeſt ſatiſfied, not by greate leaſoure, but all other buſines ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte with as much ſpede, as I coulde. The reaſon you ſee, why I maie reaſon as I doe, but not you as you woulde, is other than my bare pleaſure. And therefore I will now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede further.</p>
               <p>In this leafe and firſt ſide you ſaye, firſt that Chriſt is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelie <note place="margin">fo. 68. a. Nowell.</note> heade of the catholike churche and none but he alone, then that the ſcriptures are the iudge of all controuerſies, becauſe they
<pb facs="tcp:17023:153"/> ſhall iudge vs in the laſt greate daye.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is onelie the chiefe heade of his churche, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> that manner there is no other heade thereof, but he. Whiche as he is alſo of all the particuler churches that be in the worlde, and yeat that no let, but that there be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferiour heades vnder him, ſo is his being heade ouer the whole churche no more let, that there ſhoulde be an other inferioure heade to rule in his corporal abſence ouer the whole churche here in earth.</p>
               <p>When you talke of Scripture, and thinke it ſtraunge, that it ſhoulde not be the onelie iudge in all controuerſies, we merueile not, ſeing we remembre, that you haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to holde with youre forefathers olde condemned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes. But of this, I ſhall, when I come hereafter to your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vpon this point, haue more occaſion to ſpeake. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently I will note to the reader the wiſe reaſon, that yowe bring, to proue that the onelie ſcripture ought to be the iudge of all controuerſies, which is, becauſe it ſhall iudge bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the yow and vs in the latter daye. So ſhall oure Sauioure in his viſible perſonne M. Nowell. So ſhall the 12.

To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge youre ſelues hereof, it is a world to ſee how worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly you handle the matter, by diſcourſing ſhortly vpon two pointes.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that we by copes, veſtimentes, gilted croſſes, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>To the firſte I make anſwere, that the ceremonies and <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> ornamentes wherewith you ſcornefuly twite vs, were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely <note place="margin">The vſe of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nies.</note> reuerent ceremonies to ſtirre vp deuotion, partlye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

So far was it from this that the people was hindred thereby from the vnderſtanding of Chriſte and his holye worde, that dull affections were muche whetted, and colde deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not a little enflammed thereby. Let the maners off men that liued in that age, when theſe ceremonies and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namentes were moſt in vſe, beare witnes betwene you and me, whether they were anie hinderaunce to the knowledge of Chriſte and his worde or no. It is a ſclaunderouſe lye of youres to ſaie, that we compelled men in the ſteede off the <note place="margin">A l7e. 57.</note> true worſhippe off God, to put all religion in ceremonies, &amp; cet. As it is alſo till you can proue it, that deade beaſtes bones we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re <note place="margin">A lye. 58.</note> burniſhed ouer with burning golde. But this is M. Nowelles rhetorike good reader. After that he and his companions haue brought vs from firme faith to a raſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence, from the truthe it ſelfe to ſignes and tokens, from one faithe to a nombre of contrary ſchismes and ſectes, from the feare of God to a diſſolute ſecuritie, from praieng and faſting, to plaieng and banqueting, from repentaunce and confeſsion, of oure ſinnes to laughter and mockerye of that holie and moſte neceſſarie ſacrament: after that they haue ſpoiled the churche of fiue holie ſacramentes (the other two whiche remaine being made but bare ſignes and tokens, the one a piece of breade, the other a badge or ſigne of Chriſtianitie:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:17023:154"/> after they haue robbed God of his due honour (the bleſſed ſacrifice of his bodie and bloude) the ſainctes and friendes of God of their due worſhippe, the ſoules departed of all charitable reliefe: after they haue ſpoiled the realme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte godlie fundations, monaſteries, colleages, hoſpitalles, almes houſes, commeth ſolemnelye this proteſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, and reconuenteth vs for copes, croſſes, candleſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As for the ſeconde pointe M.

Let the drawing, hanging, and quartering, of that nombre of holie fathers of the Charter houſe, the cruell execution of that good olde man father Foreſt, and of others: let the deathe of thoſe two moſt worthy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arles of Englande, B.

But what <note place="margin">Deathe meaketh not the cauſe good.</note> then M. Nowell, is this a ſufficient argument to proue the
<pb facs="tcp:17023:155"/> cauſe good? No, no, M. Nowell, if it were ſo, yow Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries and Lutheranes ſhoulde be of all ſectes leſt eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. The Anabaptiſtes doe in this pointe go far beyonde yowe. Who to this houre dailye ſuffer in all countries where they be to be founde. And that deathe being tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled headlong in ſackes into the water they ſuffer ſecretely. Whiche maner of execution, if it had bene practiſed vpon Lutheranes and Sacramentaries, that without the ſight of the worlde, the admiration and applauſe of the brotherho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, without glorie and renowne they might haue ended in this worlde their wretched lyues, it is thought that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of them had yeat liued, either for worſe or for better. I might here bring the example of the Donatiſtes, whoſe exceſsiue deſire to dye, and to ſeale with their bloude their hereſies, S. Auguſtin in diuerſe of his epiſtles and in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ende of his thirde boke againſt the epiſtle of Parmenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus dothe well declare. But this that hath bene ſaide maye <note place="margin">

               <p>Thus muche be ſaide to M.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:17023:155"/> Nowe at the length he commeth to that whiche he ſhoulde chiefely haue anſwered in this place, that is of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieng of all controuerſies by the only ſcripture. To proue that of controuerſies riſing about the true vnderſtandinge of the ſcripture, the ſcripture it ſelfe ſhould be the iudge, he vſeth a ſimilitude, wherin he compareth vs to the phariſeis, and him ſelfe and his companions to the Apoſtles. And v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that compariſon reaſoneth in effecte as foloweth.</p>
               <p>As in the controuerſie betwene the Apoſtles and the Phariſeis, <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 69. a. 1</note> the queſtion being whether Chriſte were the true Meſsias, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles affirming, the Phariſeis denieng, if the matter had bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the interpretation and determination of the high prieſte and his conſiſtorie, we mighte yeat haue loked withe the Iues for Meſsias to come: and as it was no reaſon that in the controuerſie betwene the ſaide highe prieſtes and the Apoſtles, whether they had put Chriſte iuſtlie or vniuſtlie to death, they ſhoulde be them ſelues the iudges, who were not onelie acceſſaries, but the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall partes to the murther: ſo muſt we nowe with the Apoſtles make the ſcripture the iudge of oure controuerſies, and the pope by all reaſon muſt be excluded, as he that is the ſinke of all the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations wherewith he that hath but halfe an eye maie ſee, how ſhamefully the lawe of God is, as it was by the Phariſeis, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
               <p>Youre ſimilitude M. Nowell halteth, and is not able <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> therefore to go ſo far as it ſhould. For the better declaration whereof it is to be knowen, that as ſone as Iohn the Baptiſt <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.</note> began to preache, the Synagoge which had no promiſe to continue for euer, began to languiſhe, and ſo was at the length weakened, that after Chriſtes deathe it came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Chriſte hauing then eſtabliſhed a newe church, and made his Apoſtles the doctours and iudges thereof, and Peter the gouernour of all. Now ſee I praye you how this ſimilitude of youres holdeth. The Apoſtles being the true church of Chriſte, referred not their controuerſies to the Phariſeis which perteined not to the church, yea were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb facs="tcp:17023:156"/> and perſecutours thereof, but referred the ſame to the ſcriptures, and iudged by the ſcriptures them ſelues, ergo, the church of Chriſte that is nowe, maye not be the iudge of controuerſies, but we muſt refer the ſame to the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. I denie that conſequent M. Nowell. You proue it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtles did not referre their controuerſies to the high prieſtes and Phariſeis. I graunte you, for their prieſtehode, and auctoritie was expired. When you ſhalbe hable to proue vs Phariſeis, and your ſelues the true chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, then maie you by this ſimilitude reaſon, that as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles referred not the iudgement of the meaning of the ſcriptures to the Phariſeis, which were not the church nor of the church: ſo you will not being the church, refer the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to vs, but iudge of the ſcripture your ſelues as the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les <note place="margin">The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles being the true chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of Chriſte iudged of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> did. In the meane ſeaſon as the Apoſtles alleaged for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues the ſcripture, and ſaied it made for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (wherein they gaue iudgement of the ſcripture,) ſo foloweth it that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes church which is now, (the ſame that was then) iudgeth in al controuerſies which is the right and true ſenſe. Neither can it ſerue you to ſaie to the contrarie, as you doe ſclaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouſlie, that the worde of God hauing bene moſte ſhamefully by vs corrupted, as he that hath but halfe an eye maie well ſee, it is no reaſon being parties that we ſhoulde be iudges therein: Seing that thus might the Phariſeis haue ſaide euen of the Apoſtles them ſelues, and laied to their charges partialitie, becauſe they were Chriſtes ſcholers and diſciples, and ſo parties to the cauſe whiche they mainteined, and alſo for that you haue not as yeat proued, nor euer ſhalbe hable to proue, that Chriſtes church hath euer erred in the faith, or the heade thereof at anie time deliuered to the church any tradition or erroniouſe opinion, whereby the worde of God hath bene corrupted.

But becauſe the matter ſhall not remaine in that incertein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, I will M. Nowell anſwere youre reaſon although you woulde not anſwere mine. I ſaye therefore, that the pope as heade of Chriſtes churche, that is to ſaye, defining or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing anye thinge concerning the affaires and buſines thereof, neuer erred yeat, nor euer ſhall.

                     <hi>Lucae.</hi> 22.</note> not but obteine. Whiche priuileage ſo obteined, ſeing that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:17023:157"/> Chriſte builded his churche, not to continue for Peters ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe tyme, but for euer: we maye not doubte but that it was giuen alſo to his ſucceſſours. S. Auguſtine (as I noted befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re) <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſ.</hi> 165.</note> applied the wordes of Chriſt ſpoken of the Phariſeis ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Moiſes chaire: <hi>Quae dicunt facite: quae autem faciunt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, that Peters faithe ſhall continue in him and in his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſours, that to doe as they commaunde, is to make oure faithe ſuer and defenſible againſt the tempeſtes of all ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall ſtormes. Now harken to reaſon. Chriſte promiſed for euer to abide with his churche. S. Paule calleth it the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 1. <hi>Timo.</hi> 3.</note> piller of truthe. If Chriſte be with it, it can not erre: if it be the piller of truth it admitteth no falſehode, if it can admit no falſehode, the pope whiche is the heade thereof and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to gouerne it in earthe, can not in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement thereof erre. For if the heade might erre, then might the whole body which is bound to folow the heade. And thus bothe by auctoritie and reaſon, by experience of theſe 1500. yeares it appeareth, that there is greate difference betwene the two likelihodes that you put in the pope, and in other priuate men, touching the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. And therefore vppon the ouerthrowe of this, downe commeth all that you builde thereupon, eitherin this place or elles where.

               <p>To this place I anſwere, that whether it be Chriſoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes owne worcke from whence it is taken or no, this is a thing moſte certeine, that it is to be warily readen, as the boke which hath thruſt into it if it be Chriſoſtomes owne, or anie other catholike mannes, by ſome falſe Arrian here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike manie poiſoned and perniciouſe ſentences for the maintenaunce of the Arrians hereſie. Emongeſt other to note to you one or two, euen in the. 48. homilie, whiche is the verie nexte before this that you alleage here, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes for mainteining the equalitie of Chriſte with God the father, are nombred emongeſt heretikes, and in the. 45. they are called heretikes, that holde that the bleſſed trinitie is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall of like ſubſtance and auctoritie. And therefore in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che places as this auctor who ſo euer it be, diſſenteth from the common faithe of Chriſtes churche, we haue iuſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe to ſuſpect, that there this heretike (who hath it appeareth ouerronne the whole,) hath dipped in his fingres, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore that we reiect. As in this place it is likely that he thought to make a waie for his hereſies, by chalenging to be tried by the ſcripture onelie, the common requeſt of the Arrian heretikes, becauſe the worde they ſaide <hi>Homouſion</hi> was not to be founde in the ſcriptures. But nowe if theſe wordes were Chriſoſtomes owne, and not put in by the heretike: yeat foloweth it not that becauſe the churche is to be tried by the ſcriptures onelie, that therefore all other queſtions maie be decided by the ſame alone.

               <p>And I am ſuer that the high prieſte withe his Iuiſhe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, <note place="margin">Nowell. b. 29.</note> was able to ſaye as muche for the ordinarie ſucceſsion of the highe prieſtes his predeceſſours euen from Aaron vntill his time, for antiquitie, for conſent, and for vniuerſality againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſte and his Apoſtles (ſo fewe in compariſon, and as it ſemed la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telye ſtart vp): as yowe are able to ſaye for youre churche or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte vs. But yeat we doe thinke, that the worde of God as it was alleaged by Chriſte and hys Apoſtles againſte the ſaide high prieſte and his churche, ſo maye it and ought it allſo to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged by vs againſte youre highe prieſte and youre churche, &amp; cet.</p>
               <p>What ſo euer the Phariſeis had to ſaye againſte the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> for them ſelues, they had not this to ſaye whiche we haue againſte you, that theire churche was by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Scriptures promiſed to continue for euer.

Thus alleaged the Apoſtles the worde of God againſt the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeis. Thus muſt you alleage it againſt vs, if you will alleage it at all.</p>

Of whome ſome one came ſence to ſuche excellencie herein, that whether he atteined to his maiſters grace I am not able to pronounce, but of this I am ſuer, that of all that were in Oxforde in his time he bare the bell. Yow knowe I dare ſaie Alexander Nowell, that taught Gnato his nurtor to drawe his cap ouerthwart his felowe Parmeno his noſe, when he ſaluted him with <hi>plurima ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſuum impertit Parmenonem Gnato.</hi> And thus much might be ſaide to yowe had I euer practiſed that whiche yowe ſo often haue taught other to doe, as by the leſſons whiche like a maiſter in that facultie yow here giue, maie to anye man eaſely appeare. My parable of the felon is not imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, being brought in to diſproue the heretikes aſſertion crieng for onelie ſcripture, and reiecting the viſible heade of the churche, whiche is the thing that in this firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition I take on me to proue.

I perceiue the olde prouerbe is true, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de will creepe where it can not go. For how doe yow hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe him I praie yow? Forſothe yow ſaie.</p>
               <p>If the felon appealing for the triall of his innocencie to God, <note place="margin">Nowell. fo. 77. a. 12</note> can bring for him ſo manie teſtimonies of goddes owne mouthe, as we are able for oure innocencie to bring teſtimonies of wordes proceding from the mouthe of God, and of oure ſauiour Ieſus Chriſte, and yeat it will not ſerue the ſeelie felowe, nor helpe him anie thing in his plea of not guiltie: then I thinke there can not be a fitter lawe to procede againſt him then the popes canons (which yow knowe well M.

<pb facs="tcp:17023:167"/> And thus I let his parable paſſe.</p>
               <p>By what name yow call me M. Nowell, hangman or <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> forman it forceth not, youre tongue is no ſclaundre. It maie beſeme me well inough to be miuried by that ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue by the whiche Chriſte ſuffreth him ſelfe and his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſainctes to be blaſphemed. But I praie yowe how helpe yow this pore felon for all the malice that yowe beare to me? If he coulde yow ſaie, bringe as good teſtimonie of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie owte off goddes worde, as yowe can for youres. &amp;c. If he brought no better, then were he like to ſtretche a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For let vs ſuppoſe youre ſelfe (as meete a man as anie that I knowe) to occupie this felons roume at the barre, and ſee for youre onelie iuſtifieng faithe what one worde off ſcripture yow haue? That the ſacrament of the altar is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a figure, what teſtimonie of goddes mouthe coulde yow bring? That the laie princes are appointed by Chriſte to be the ſupreme gouernours in all eccleſiaſticall thinges and cauſes, (no prince being Chriſtened at the writing of the ſcriptures) that all controuerſies ought to be tried by one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſcriptures, where is the ſcripture? If the felon coulde bring as good teſtimonies as yow, were he not now thinke yow like to be muche holpen by yowe? But I merueile where youre wittes were M Nowell, that yow be ſo far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſene, as where as I putt the caſe in a felon guiltie and that had well deſerued to dye: yow woulde euer make ſuch a ſuppoſition, as though ſuche a malefactour might finde anie teſtimonies in the ſcripture to proue him innocent. But I knowe youre meaning well enough. Yow thought couertly to ſignifie, that there was no felon that had ſo grieuouſly offendid, but that he might aſwell proue his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie by the ſcriptures, as yowe youre doctrine thereby. Except yow ſo ment, to wreſt my example to youre mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

               <p>Becauſe the Apologie taketh the worde churche for the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> churche, which hath not nor can poſsibly haue, anie earthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:17023:168"/> heade ouer it to gouerne it, as hath bene often at large hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared.</p>
               <p>Whereſoeuer you haue declared anie thing before tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <note place="margin">Dorman. See the 11.

Yow might declare the good affection, that yow haue to proue it, and therfore yow ſaide circunſpectly that you had declared, for ſurely yow neuer proued it hetherto.</p>
               <p>I ſaide that youre argument did not holde, whereby yow reaſoned that there could be no other heade of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes vniuerſall churche becauſe Chriſte was him ſelfe: no more then if one woulde ſaie, that the prieſte did not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, forgiue ſinnes, &amp;c. becauſe Chriſt do the theſe thinges by the meanes of his miniſtres. To this yow ſaie, that theſe examples make rather againſte me then with me. But why M. Nowell I praie yow? Youre reaſon foloweth.</p>
               <p>For one chiefe heade hath diuerſe vndreminiſtres in diuerſe <note place="margin">Nowell. fo. 79. a. 1.</note> ſeruices, and places vſually: but what perteineth that to proue that there muſt be one heade ouer all places, and ſeruices eccleſiaſticall thorough out the whole worlde which is vnpoſsible to be?</p>
               <p>Theſe examples were neuer brought M. Nowel to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> that there muſt be one heade ouer the whole churche, but to remoue the fooliſhe argument made againſt that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne heade: now they make not for one heade ſaye yow, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, they make rather againſt me.</p>
               <p>Neither can youre ſcholaſticall diſtinction of <hi>caput abſolutum</hi> and <note place="margin">Nowell.</note>

For there can not poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be one only heade ouer all the church, more then there can be one vniuerſall ciuile heade abſolute in earth, ouer all the worlde it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>What a blinde harpar is this, that harpeth allwayes vpon

               <p>I knowe M. Dorman dothe ſo qualifie this the popes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macye <note place="margin">Nowell. 22. a.</note> terming him <hi>caput miniſteriale</hi> the miniſteriall heade, for that Chriſte is the abſolute heade of all. But yeat in reſpecte off the whole churche, as being vnder the Pope, he will haue hym called <hi>caput</hi> the heade. But I woulde haue hym to make that relation of <hi>caput,</hi> and theſe wordes <hi>ſeruus ſeruorum</hi> to agree, and to be bothe <hi>caput</hi> and <hi>ſeruus</hi> or <hi>miniſter, reſpectu eiuſdem:</hi> the head and the ſeruaunt in one reſpecte, eſpeciallye claiming ſuche a <note n="*" place="margin">M.

               <p>Belike you woulde haue appoſed Chriſte, if it had bene <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> youre chaunce to be preſent, when he ſaide. <hi>Qui minor eſt</hi>

But do you not youre ſelfe confeſſe that euerye biſhop is the heade of hys dioceſſe? And howe then M. Nowell doth that agree (I vſe youre owne wordes) with the humble eccleſiaſtical miniſtery? Is your heade the biſhop a headye ſeruant and a ſeruile heade? Kinges and Princes are they not the heades of the people
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17023:169"/> whome they gouerne, and yeat in that verie reſpecte that they be heades, miniſtres notwithſtanding (as S. Paule wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth) <note place="margin">

               <p>M. Dorman harpeth to muche vpon one ſtring oute of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne <note place="margin">Nowell. b. 16.</note> for his purpoſe, I meane the example off the Iuiſh high prieſte. &amp; cet.</p>
               <p>Who twangeth moſte vppon one ſtring, that let the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> reader iudge. Once this is ſuer, that the ſtring that you ſhoulde ſtrike here, you touche not ſo muche as on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. For I bringe not in this example of the high prieſte off the Iues, at this tyme (as becauſe I once did, you dreame that I doe ſtill) to proue that there ought to be one onelye heade in Chriſtes churche, as there was emongeſt the Iues, but to detecte the vanitie of this reaſon of youres. Chriſte is heade of the churche and able to rule the ſame him ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe alone, <hi>ergo,</hi> there nedeth no other. To this anſwered I, ſo was <note place="margin">M. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth my reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and twa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a falſe ſtring.</note> he being God heade of the Iuiſh Synagoge alſo, and as wel hable to rule the ſame without anye helpe or meanes as he is nowe to rule his churche: Yeat was his pleaſure to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointe a highe prieſte &amp;c. And therefore that ought to be no reaſon to perſuade vs that he dothe not or maye not do the lyke nowe. To this becauſe yow were not hable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye, you diſſembled my meaning, as a little before in this verye place you doe, when you ſaye, that my examples make rather againſt me then with me. The whiche practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe you vſe alſo hereafter as in place ſhal be declared. For this matter I haue no more to ſaye, but to aduiſe you that you take youre harpe into youre hande, and twang once vpon the right ſtring.</p>
               <p>In proſecuting the confutation of that naughtie argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">fol. 80. a. 24. 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 15.</note> of youre Apologie, I vſe the examples of Saule cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the ſcripture the heade ouer the tribues of Iſrael, of
<pb facs="tcp:17023:170"/> the huſbande called by Paule the heade of his wife, off the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> Archebiſhoppe heade ouer the other biſhoppes of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, and conclude thereupon, that as it is no good reaſon to ſaye: God was heade of the tribues of Iſrael, therefore Saule was not. Chriſte is heade of vs all, men and wemen: therefore the huſbande is not heade of the wife: The Arche biſhoppe is heade of the other biſhoppes of his prouince, Therefore the biſhoppes be not hedes: euen ſo that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of youre Apologie: Chriſte is heade of his churche, therfore there is no other head, is a faulty argument, becauſe if it were good, it ſhoulde exclude alſo (whiche it dothe not) the other heades that I named, confeſſed to be true heades in earthe. For, <hi>quae ratio partis ad partem, eadem totius ad to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum:</hi> the ſame proportion that is of the parte to the parte, the ſame is the proportion of the whole to the whole: that is, if their maie be a heade of one dioceſſe in earthe which is parte of the whole, notwithſtanding that God is heade of the whole, there is no let by this argument but there maie be an other heade alſo vnder him ouer the whole. And ſo I proue the reaſon of the Apologie naught in the whole, <hi>quia non valet in partibus,</hi> becauſe it is not good in the partes. To this reaſon of mine you neuer make anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, but diſſembling it as you did the other before, you ſaie, that I bring theſe examples to proue that there be diuerſe ſeuerall <note place="margin">b. 13.</note> heades in earthe vnder Chriſte, So I did in dede. But why woulde I proue that? To proue that there ought to be one heade ouer the whole. Why ſaye you ſo for ſhame M. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well? Why diſſemble you that whiche anye man that hathe his common ſenſe can not but ſee to be otherwiſe? I bringe it to ſhewe howe abſurde it is for you to graunte, that ouer the tribues off Iſrael there maye be a heade, ouer ſeuerall churches there maye be heades, withoute derogation to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17023:170"/> Chriſtes honour who is the chiefe, and yeat you will not graunte ſo muche to the whole churche for the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that pretended reaſon, (becauſe Chriſte is the heade) which letteth not in particuler churches. And therfore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Hoſius</hi> nor I care, whether Saul were head of the tribue of Leui or no, this example prouing how euer it were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently our intent, whiche is to diſproue your foliſhe reaſon that becauſe Chriſt is heade of his church there nedeth no other. When <hi>Hoſius</hi> or I alleage this place to gather thereby that there ought to be one head in earth vnder Chriſt ouer all churches, then we will folowe your minde in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluding. In the meane ſeaſon we take youre argument, that becauſe Chriſte is the onelie heade ouer the vniuerſall churche, therefore there nedeth no other generall heade vnder him, to be by this example ſufficiently confuted, as before I ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. Yeat becauſe your deſire is that it maie be conſidered, whether when the ſcripture ſaieth that Saul was made heade of the tribues of Iſrae<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>l, he were appointed heade ouer the tribue of Leui alſo, that is ouer the cleargie, conſidre it I praie yow and ſpare not, and when yow haue all conſidered and done, yow ſhall perceiue howe muche this exemption of the cleargie from the auctoritie of king Saul maketh againſt yow and youre companions, that will make kinges to rule the cleargie in cauſes eccleſiaſticall. I doubte not but ſome of youre ſide that haue more ſtaied heades then yowe, and that are leſſe paſsionat, will ſaie that yowe might haue kepte this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to youre ſelfe ſtill.</p>
               <p>And where yow mingle kinges and biſhoppes together whoſe <note place="margin">Nowell. b. 30. &amp; fo. 81. a. 1.</note> offices are diſtinct, and vſe the examples of the Archebiſhop off Cauntorbury, and the biſhop of London: what titles ſo euer your biſhoppes when they were in thoſe roumes vſed or abuſed, I am ſuer they who be nowe in place, take it for their chiefe honour to be and to be called alſo gods miniſters in his churche.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17023:171"/>
               <p>What a worlde is this when proteſtantes complaine of <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> mingling kinges and biſhoppes together? As though the worlde knewe not who confoundeth and iumbleth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe two offices, they or we. But the faulte is founde with me for reaſoning from their offices whiche be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte. Why yow knowe M. Nowell if you haue not forgotten youre logicke, that it is not neceſſarie that thinges compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhould be one in all pointes. They agree in this that kinges and biſhoppes are bothe heades and gouernours, the pointe where in the compariſon was made. Nowe whereas to this that I ſaie, that the B. of Cauntorbury is heade off the biſhoprike and dioceſſe of London (as he is of all the biſhoprikes within his prouince) and that yeat a man can not infer vpon this that therefore the biſhopp of London is not heade of that his dioceſſe, as yow doe in ſaing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſte is heade of the whole churche therfore there is no other vnder him, whereas I ſaie to this yow anſwere, that youre biſhoppes take it for theire chiefe honour to be and to be called gods miniſtres in his churche, ſo doe oure biſhoppes to M. Nowell, and vſed no other titles, then thoſe whiche your falſe biſhoppes hauing falſely vſurped vſe and abuſe at this daie, but what is that to the matter that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of? Well be bolde man and bluſhe not: coffe owt that tuffe fleaume that lieth in youre throte, and ſaie that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chebiſhop is of no more power then the biſhop. If yow had ſaide thus, then had yow anſwered yeat ſome thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as nowe yowe haue anſwered nothinge. Except this maie ſtande for youre anſwere, when yow proue it, that neither Archebiſhop nor biſhop maie be called heades of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <note place="margin">fo. 81. a. 6.</note> that they gouerne, but rather kinges and princes. Whiche opinion becauſe yowe ſee that it is contrarie to all <note place="margin">M. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to helpe his owne contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by a foliſhe ſhift.</note> that yow ſaied before touching the places of S.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17023:171"/> and S. Hierome, where yowe confeſſed ſo often that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie biſhop was heade of his owne dioceſſe, to ſalue that ſore yow ſaie.</p>
               <p>Yeat I denie not but that biſhoppes maie be, and haue bene <note place="margin">Nowell. a. 17.</note> though improprely, named heades euen by good writers, as the ſcholemaiſter of a prince, in that the prince is his ſcholer is his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Surely biſhoppes are muche beholden vnto yowe, that <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> yow graunte them ſo muche auctoritie ouer their flocke, as yow had ouer your ſcholers when yow were ſcholemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Weſtminſtre. But I praie you M. Nowell cal to your reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce, that S. Ciprian ſaieth of the biſhop that he is in the dioceſſe where he ruleth the iudge in Chriſtes ſtede, that S.

But admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting euen youre owne ſimilitude, you ſhall ſee how mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che you haue ſaide for the auctoritie of biſhoppes againſt that vnlaufull othe which you exact of all men. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the ſcholemaiſtre is in his ſchole the heade of his ſcholers all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be princes: ſo be biſhoppes the heades of ſuche as be in their ſeuerall biſhoprikes all though they be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but the ſcholemaiſter in his ſchoole is the ſupreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour in all thinges and cauſes belonging to the ſchole: his ſcholers allthough princes hauing in thoſe thinges no power to commaunde. <hi>Ergo</hi> the biſhoppes are, (euery one in his churche) the ſupreme gouernours in all thinges ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, and princes haue no auctoritie to entremedle therein. The which concluſion deduced M. nowell from your compariſon, as youre ſelfe with honeſtie can not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, ſo I truſt it ſhall diſpleaſe no prince, conſidering that,

In the proſecuting of theſe pointes, you ſhewe right well that Nowell will be Nowell, as well as Geta wilbe Geta, as if the reader vnderſtand not I truſt he ſhall ere it be long.</p>
               <p>To the firſte I anſwere, that I neuer burdened you with
<pb facs="tcp:17023:174"/> the ſelfe ſame hereſie that <hi>Suencfeldius</hi> helde, but onely tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de you that by harping to muche on this ſtring: Chriſt is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer preſent with his churche, therefore there nedeth no man to ſuccede him in the whole, yow might comme as neare hys hereſie, as he that you charged therewith was farre from it. The laboure therefore that you toke, the incke and paper that you ſpent, to purge youre ſelfe in this pointe was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluouſe, and might well haue bene ſpared. And ſo would you I thinke alſo haue done, had you not thought that it ſhoulde helpe youre cauſe not a little, to perſuade the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der off me, that I were an euill tongued man, and that I toke no conſcience to ſcalundre and ſowe vntrue repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of ſuche good men as yowe be. And therefore you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thus:</p>

               <p>Lo good reader, marke here I beſeche the, the vnhoneſt <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> dealing of M. Nowell.

Is it all one M. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel to ſaie yo doe no other then <hi>Arrius</hi> did, and you leane

Againſt tranſſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation yow vſe the ſame grounde, that the Arrians did againſt the word <hi>Homouſion:</hi> for thei beleued it not becauſe they ſaide it was not expreſſed in ſcripture, and yow beleue not the doctrine of tranſſubſtantiation for the ſame cauſe: yeat is it not true that you doe no other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they in al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, becauſe yow doe the ſame that they doe in one thing.</p>
               <p>Youre railing talcke, and ſlaunderouſe reportes in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling my doinges doltiſhe, my heade fooliſhe, &amp;c. becauſe <note place="margin">fo. 83. b. 14</note> they be the floures of youre rhetorike ſtrowed here to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>autifie this firſt pointe, and alſo becauſe how true they are I had rather make the worlde iudge then my ſelfe, I eſteme not, and therefore I paſſe ouer in ſilence. Whereas yow li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me to <hi>Iudas,</hi> for that yow ſaie I haue forſaken my mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Chriſte in hope of worldly gaine, all though partly the condition and ſtate of my life that I nowe leade will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere for me in that reſpecte: yeat thus muche I maie ſaie beſide, that when I left youre peſtilent and perniciouſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s being of age betwene fiftene and ſixtene, it is not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely that I caſt anie great eye after worldly gaine. If I had, I would belike hauing left my houſe and the hope of ſo good a felowſhip in ſo famouſe a colleage as the new colleage in Oxford is knowen to be, for my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience ſake in king Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes daies, haue ben afterward when the time ſerued bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a greater prowler, for liuinges the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was, the greateſt and only liuing that I had or deſired to haue, being a felowſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe in Allſollen colleage. Or if fortune had not fauoured me then, if worldlie gaine had bene ſo muche in mine eye, I woulde in this time haue putt my ſelfe forwarde, when I ſawe ſome of mine owne fellowes as meane as I, called to be Chauncelours to biſhoppes, other ſome to be Archedea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, manie to greate and riche benefices, and not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riewiſe
<pb facs="tcp:17023:175"/> haue abandoned all and ſought ſtrange countries, thinking there to finde worldlye gaine. As for D. Harding allthough he be able to ſaie muche more for him ſelfe, yet this maie I ſaie becauſe it is manifeſt, that in refuſing to ioyne with yowe in youre hereſies, he loſt as good promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as yow haue anie, and was a man coulde he haue framed his conſcience to your procedinges, like to haue had as good parte of worldly gaine as yow or a better man then yowe either. But of this lewde lye I can ſaie no more but <note place="margin">A lye. 70.</note> 
                  <hi>tranſeat cum coeteris.</hi> Nowe to the ſeconde point, in whiche yow procede thus:</p>
               <p>Swenckfield (ſaieth M. Dorman) doth ſaie, we muſt haue no <note place="margin">Nowell. fo. 84. a. 6</note> ſcripture &amp;c. The Huguenotes and heretikes ſaie we muſte haue no pope of Rome to be heade of Chriſtes vniuerſall churche. Lo Sir yow ſee a greate likenes betwene them &amp;c.</p>
               <p>No greate likeneſſe indede M. Nowell as yowe haue <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> handled the matter. But if yowe had trulie and whollie reherſed my wordes, and added the cauſe whiche the Swenckfeldian bringeth for his opinion (becauſe God can <note place="margin">M. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth away the chiefe parte off my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> teache vs without) withe the reaſon that yowe alleage why we ought to haue no heade of the churche (becauſe God is the heade him ſelfe, and can rule it without any other) then yff yow had cried, Lo Sir you ſee a greate likeneſſe betwene them, other men had bene like to haue ſoothed that in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, whiche nowe yowe vtter ſo pleaſantly in ſporte. As yowe cutt of here the two reaſons, in whiche bothe the Swenckfeldians and yow agree, they to baniſhe awaie the ſcripture, and yow to ouerthrowe the heade of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che: ſo to make the conference the more vnlike, yowe chaunge my wordes by caſting in of the name of the pope of Rome, whome I name not here, but intreate onelie in generall wordes of one heade that ought to be in chriſtes
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17023:175"/> churche.</p>
               <p>The nexte pointe wherein I compare yowe withe the <note place="margin">A. 10.</note> Swenckfeldians is, that as they reiecte the ſcriptures ſainge they are but dead lettres, ſo doe yowe the pope beinge the heade of the churche, ſaing that he is but a ſinfull man as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are, and therefore as vnmete being but a ſinfull man to gouerne the whole churche, as is the ſcripture whiche they call deade lettres and to be accounted emongeſt other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to ſignifie to vs the will and pleaſure of oure Lorde God. Thus haue I ſhewed the ſimilitude, why doe yowe ſkornefully mocke at it, and ſhewe not rather the diſsimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude?</p>
               <p>Finally I compare yowe withe the Swenckfeldians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">A. 16.</note> as they barre God of ſuche externall meanes as it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the pleaſed him teache to vs by, that is the ſcripture: ſo doe you of ſuche externall gouernour as it pleaſeth him to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne his churche by, that is, one generall heade to gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the whole. Thus I reaſoned, and thus yow doe. Againſt the whiche yowe haue nothing to ſaie, but to ſinge youre olde ſong, often ſaide but neuer proued, that it belongeth to <note place="margin">B. 8.</note> onelie Chriſte to gouerue his churche, and that it is impoſsible for one only man to doe it, and ſo conclude with a fit of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt the pope, and there an ende.</p>
               <p>Whereas M. Dorman procedeth ſaing, that we tell Chriſte that <note place="margin">Nowell. fo. 85. a. 7.</note> he is of age, and able to doe it him ſelfe, and that therfore there is no remedie but he muſt nedes come downe and giue anſwere to all oure wiſe demaundes in his owne perſon: I truſt that all men do knowe that M. Dorman did knowe, that he lied lewdely when he did write this.</p>
               <p>I lied not M. Nowell. For allthough yow ſaye not ſo <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> muche in wordes, youre dedes ſpeake as much all together, ſeing that yow alowe vs not one ſuche heade, as maie by his auctoritie ende and determine all controuerſies riſing
<pb facs="tcp:17023:176"/> in the church, without the which either the churche muſt from time to time be miſerably ſhaken with ſchiſmes (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che I thinke you meane not) either Chriſte come downe and giue anſwere in his owne perſon, whiche is the thing that yow be offendid with me for ſaing of you, vpon good and iuſt cauſe as you ſee. Hauing nowe as yow thinke well purged youre parte, yow will matche vs withe Swenck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, and therfore you ſaye.</p>
               <p>And M. Dorman and all the aduerſaries to the truth maie be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, <note place="margin">Nowell. a. 30. b. 3.</note> to charge vs as not alowing Chriſte meanes to worcke his ſpirituall grace by, but vexing him by calling for his corporal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: whereas they them ſelues (as thoſe that thinke he can doe nothing excepte he be corporall preſent) woulde turmoyle him euery houre, and minute alſo from place to place, and would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon him allſo in narowe and ſtreight roumes, paſsing little eaſe in the tower of London manifolde.</p>
               <p>If you alowe him ſuche meanes as yow ſpeake of, why <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> make you ſo muche adoe about this, that he can rule his churche alone, that he nedeth no other &amp; cet? It is vntruly and blaſphemouſly ſaide of you, that we woulde turmoile Chriſte euery houre and minute (which you meane of his preſence in the bleſſed ſacrament) from place to place, that that pretiouſe body of his being reſerued for the benefite of Chriſtian men is impriſoned. We abhorre ſuche groſſe and locall mutation as muche as yow. We ſaye withe Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome: <hi>O miraculum: O dei benignitatem, qui cum patre ſurſum ſedet, in illo ipſo temporis articulo omnium manibus pertractatur.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Sacerdotio</hi>
                  </note> O miracle, o the benignitie of God, which when he ſitteth aboue with his father is in the <note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> ſame mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of time hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with all mens handes. Thus it appeareth by Chriſoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, that Chriſte is not called out of heauen, but being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there with his father is alſo truly in the ſacrament. We abhor youre figuratiue preſence, your tropicall eating.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:17023:176"/> We alowe not theſe meanes, becauſe by the ſcriptures it is manifeſt that Chriſte excludeth ſuche meanes him ſelfe, and of his infinite goodnes giueth him ſelfe corporally to vs. Wherefore there is betwene vs and the Swenckfeldians in this pointe no conformitie at all.</p>
               <p>The nexte point that you compare vs in to the Swenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldians, <note place="margin">fo. 86. a. 6 Nowell.</note> is, becauſe they forbid the Scriptures vtterly: we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them to be reade of the laitie, keepe them in an vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, and burne them written in knowen language.</p>
               <p>There was neuer yeat any ſuch prohibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the learne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> ſorte of the laitie did not, or might not reade the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. If to the vnlearneder ſorte it were not permitted, you ſhall finde that it proceded rather of reuerence towardes the ſcriptures, and feare of that whiche nowe we ſee come to paſſe, leſt while euerie man ſhould folowe his owne ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, the worlde might be filled full of errours, and the holie ſcripture (as it happeneth to thinges that be common) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and ſet at naught, then of anie ſuche minde as with the which thoſe heretikes reiected the ſcripture. We burne Tindalles teſtament: we burne Mathewes, Couerdale his and Geneua Bibles, not becauſe they are ſcripture, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are by falſe tranſlations poiſoned ſcripture. If the mother take the poiſoned breade oure of the childes han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not infer hereupon that ſhe will giue it no brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de at all. We agree not therfore in this point with Swenck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fielde. Yow procede in youre compariſons and ſaie.</p>

All that goeth befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is impertinent to the reaſon, and decked with the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed flowers of youre railing Rhetorike. The obiection of Moyſes and Aaron, wherby you would proue that there were two high prieſtes at once, &amp;c. is anſwered by me, if it had pleaſed you to haue taken the paynes to haue loked ſo farre in the 34. and 35. leafe of my firſte booke. Nowe to the place of <hi>Chore, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiron</hi> of the whiche you ſaye <note place="margin">Nowell. B. 5.</note> thus.</p>
               <p>Concerning the reaſon made by Chore, Dathan, and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, that the people ought not to obeye their gouernours becauſe they be all holye, <note n="*" place="margin">Theſe wordes <hi>and the lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de is emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt them</hi> left oute by M. No<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>well. Dorman.</note> and that therefore the magiſtrates ought not to lifte them ſelues aboue the Lordes people, it is not oure reaſon &amp; cet.</p>
               <p>No in dede M. Nowell as you haue alleaged it, it is not
<pb facs="tcp:17023:182"/> youre reaſon. But if you had trulye reported it, it woulde haue gone as nere to your reaſon as twelue penſe to a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. But you doe here as you did before with the reaſons of Swenckfielde, that is, leaue oute the chiefe reaſon whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein the compariſon is made, and then crie oute vpon me for making ſuche wiſe compariſons. Who ſeeth not that I compare you hereto theſe ſchiſmatikes refuſing to obeye Moiſes and Aaron, not becauſe they ſaide they were all holy, but becauſe they added, <hi>&amp; in ipſis eſt Dominus,</hi> and the Lorde is preſent with the multitude, as you refuſe that one heade of Chriſtes churche, becauſe Chriſt is preſent with his churche. As for the wordes that you note here in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of youre boke, <hi>multitudo ſanctorum,</hi> and <hi>populus domini papae,</hi> as though you coulde thereby make ſome ſhewe that this place might be applyed to Chanon Chore, Deane Dathan and his felowes, it deſerueth to be rather laughed at then anſwered, ſeing that bothe it is a manifeſte lye whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewith you ſclaundre the cleargye, who neuer called them ſelues the holy people of the greate Lorde of Rome, as you here feine, and alſo it is well knowen, that what ſo euer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertyes and immunities the cleargye had, the ſame were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the faithe encreaſed by Emperours and kinges them ſelues, and therefore they were moſte far from the maner of reaſoning vſed by theſe ſchiſmatikes.</p>
               <p>Nowe whereas M. Dorman alleageth the Apologie as thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, <note place="margin">Nowell. B. 25.</note> that the churche hathe no neede of anie other ruler, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt is with it: truth it is, if M. Dorma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe meane one only heade of the vniuerſall church. For Chriſte nedeth no ſuche gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gouernour, ſeing he is bothe preſent him ſelfe continually by his ſpirite as he promiſed, and alſo for that he hathe in euery pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culier countrie and churche his Moiſes and Aaron, that is to ſaye his feuerall deputies in his ſteede euerye where here in earth: for that no one mortall man can poſsibly ſuffice to the gouernaunce of the whole worlde or churche. &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:17023:182"/>
               <p>If he nede gouernours of euery peculier churche, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> he is no leſſe preſent then with the whole: why nedeth he not aſwell one chiefe heade to gouerne the whole? who ſhall emongeſt ſo manie heades diuided into partes, euerye one thinking his opinion to be beſt, ſtrike the ſtroke and preſerue vnitie? If yowe ſaie God maie ſo preſerue euerie biſhop that he fall not into hereſie, you put god to worke daily mo miracles, then he doth to preſerue the chiefe biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of all whiche yet you ſtagger to graunte as a thinge impoſsible. The wordes folowing in youre Apologie, that no one mortall man can ſuffice to the gouernement of the whole <note place="margin">fo. 96. a. 3.</note> worlde or church, I of my accuſtomed ſinceritie omitted yow ſaye. And what haue you gotten by it, nowe you haue alleaged it youre ſelfe? Verilie this, that you will make all men vnderſtande, that god is able with you to doe no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, then you liſt to giue him leaue: but of this I haue entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before ſufficiently. You ſaye that you are far from rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> againſt youre naturall ſoueraigne and other gods miniſters appointed to gouerne you &amp;c. But how farre M. Nowell, I <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> praie you? Who made the boke of ſucceſsion at home? Who ſounded the two traiterouſe blaſtes againſt the mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrouſe regiment of women their Quene being a woman? From whence were they blowen but from the lake of Gehenna? Who grudgeth againſt the princes ordinaunce in matters indifferent and of ſmall importance, no greater then of a ſquare cap? Who made warre againſt their prince in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land? Who ſet all Fraunce in an vprore againſt their king? Who but that vnhappy vermine the proteſtants? <hi>That which foloweth fol.</hi> 96. <hi>b. and</hi> 97. <hi>a. b. is anſwered before.</hi>

               <p>THIS matter hath bene ſufficiently handled before in the 21. chapitre. And allthough in me it be a greate faulte and highly laide to my charge, to alleage thriſe one place of ſcripture, yet muſte yowe good readers beare withe M. Nowell, if he alleage his abſurde and wicked aſſertions mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re then ſix times thriſe, and maie not in any wiſe twite him with the prouerbe <hi>Crambe his,</hi> that to muche of one thing is naught: yea allthough he neuer proue anie of them once. But maie yowe not be aſhamed M. Nowell ſo vniuſtly to <note place="margin">M.

By what auctoritie clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me yow (I praie yowe tell vs) ſuche libertie, that yowe maie ſpeake of the ſcriptures that whiche is vnlaufull and plaine blaſphemie, and other maie not vſe ſo muche as ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes or compariſons betwene the ſcriptures and other prophane thinges? Why is it laufull for yow ſo oftentimes to repeate theſe heatheniſhe wordes, that it is impoſsible for one man (aſsiſted by gods grace for otherwiſe we affirme it not) to gouerne the whole churche of Chriſte, that we be like to the Phariſeis and high prieſtes of the Iues, you to Chriſte and his apoſtles, that there ought no more to be one chiefe heade to gouerne the churche then one empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to gouerne the whole worlde, that the pope can not be iudge in his owne cauſe (as though goddes cauſe were his owne priuate cauſe) with ſuche like abſurdities a nombre mo, and maie not be laufull for me to alleage thriſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſcripture of God, to proue three ſeuerall pointes. Firſte
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17023:183"/> that it coulde not be likely, that God prouiding for his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen <note place="margin">The place of Deuter. alleaged by me thriſe, to three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſes.</note> people the Iues a chiefe and heade gouernour to ende and determine all their controuerſies, woulde not for his churche whiche he loueth more tendrely, where he knewe ſhoulde be greater nede, doe the like: nexte to anſwere the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby youre fooliſhe reaſon: Chriſte is heade of his churche, and preſent allwaies withe it, therefore there nedeth no other. By which reaſon I ſaide, that God ſhoulde haue prouided for the Iues no chiefe heade neither, becauſe he was preſent alſo with them, and no leſſe their heade then oures. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, to ſhewe that the onelye conference of ſcriptures is not ſufficient to ende all controuerſies riſing vpon the doubtefull meaninge off the lettre, ſeing that if it ſo had, allmightie God woulde of all likelihode haue bidden the Iues doe ſo, and not trouble themſelues and the high prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte for the matter. Thus yowe ſee good readers howe I alleage thriſe thys one place off ſcripture, whiche argueth M. Nowell ſaieth miſerable diſtreſſe. But I truſte ſuche as be off ſounder iudgement haue learned to giue that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to holie ſcripture, that what ſo euer they ſee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by one onelye ſentence taken out of the ſame, that they will thinke as ſufficiently proued, as iff there had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne many brought therfore. If a man ſhould aſke of M. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well what diſtreſſe he was in, when to proue that there muſt be manie kinges to gouerne the worlde, he alleageth ſo often alone without anie other in his whole boke, that ſentence of Eccleſiaſticus ſome times twiſe in one leafe as <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:17023:184"/> brought in? What ſhoulde I tell you of the ſame textes and gloſes ſo often reherſed to one purpoſe? Youre ſelues good readers in reading this boke of his, ſhall beare me witnes that I lye not. You haue here repeated againe, that the high prieſte muſt iudge according to the lawe whiche no man denieth, for ſo ſaieth the texte that he ſhall: that S. Paule <note place="margin">a 29. b. 28.</note> threatened Gods vengeaunce to the high prieſte, that S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and S. Iohn aſked boldely him and his, whether it were right in the ſight of god, to heare them rather then God, to all the which you haue my anſwere before in anſwering the. 59. b. and the. 68. leaues a. You haue beſide ſerued in the ſeconde time, the places of S. Auſten, and Chriſoſtome, to <note place="margin">fo. 99. a. b</note> proue that conference of the textes of ſcripture one withe the other, is a good waye to atteine to the vnderſtanding of doubtefull places. Thus much was ſaide before in the. 72. leafe b. to the which in the ſame place I anſwered as I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we doe, that it is a verie good waie in dede, but not ſuche as is able allwaies to aſſure vs of the right ſenſe. Nowe iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge I beſeche you good readers, who vſeth ofteneſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate the ſame thing, M. Nowell or I.</p>
               <p>Where as you ſaye: M. Nowell. And no doubte but the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh <note place="margin">Nowell. b 26.</note> prieſt appointed to reſolue other men of their doubtes did him ſelfe vſe the ſaide conference of ſcripture, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To that I anſwere, that this maketh nothing for youre <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> purpoſe if he ſo did. For allthough the high prieſte whoſe lippes were promiſed to keepe knowledge, were for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <note place="margin">

The generall councelles at this daie, the popes at all times, haue vſed you maie be ſure this waye alſo of interpreting doubtes ariſing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17023:184"/> vpon the ſcripture. We miſlike it not therefore in them to whome it apperteineth to explicate ſuche doubtes, but in ſuche onelie as being priuate men vſe this for a cloke to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their hereſies: in them we miſlike it thus far, as either they content not themſelues with ſuche ſenſe as the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le churche hath allreadie vpon the conference of ſuche doubtefull places agreed vpon, either elles taking that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice from publike auctoritie, will preſume them ſelues to giue ſuche ſentence (proceding this waye) as maye beſt ſeme to make for their ſinguler opinions.</p>
               <p>To this reaſon of mine, that if laing and conferring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of one texte with an other were the ſureſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt waye to come to the true vnderſtanding of all doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, God woulde of all likelihode haue commaunded it, and not haue ſent his people to the high prieſt, nowe at the length M. Nowell in the ende of two leaues and a halfe, in the which he hathe done no other thing but firſt vttred himſelfe how muche this place of Deutero. grieueth him, then vainely repeated that the prieſte is bound to iudge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Goddes lawe, that when he did not S. Paule cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, S. Peter and S. Iohn diſobeied him, that conference of the ſcripture is good and neceſſary: now I ſaye after that he hathe filled vp two leaues and a halfe with this matter denied by no man, and with the which he filled as manye before, he maketh a proffer to anſwere in this wiſe.</p>
               <p>But ſaieth M. Dorman God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded not, any ſuche confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <note place="margin">Nowell. fo. 100. a. 29. b. 1.</note> of ſcriptures, but only to reſorte to the high prieſte: yeat I truſt M. Dorman is not ignorant what it meaneth, that God and oure Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt doe ſo earneſtly exhorte all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t reading and ſtudie of the ſcriptures, and doe condemne the ignorance or wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of knowledge therof. And where he ſaieth, God hath not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded ſuche conference of ſcriptures (which yeat in effecte he hath commaunded) it is happy that he can not ſhewe where God hath forbidden it, which if he coulde he woulde not haue failed to
<pb facs="tcp:17023:185"/> haue done.</p>
               <p>You tell men what I ſaide, whiche they knewe before, <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> but your anſwere to my ſaing whiche here they loked to haue had, you giue them not. I ſaye that if conference of one place of the ſcripture withe an other had bene the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt waye to reſolue all doubtes, God woulde rather haue commaunded that then going to the prieſte: you anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, that God and Chriſte exhorte vs to the diligent ſtudie of ſcripture, that <note n="*" place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference here me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is ſuche as muſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue for the finall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of all doubtes.</note> ſuche conference he hathe commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in effect (without ſhewing when, where, or by what wordes, notwithſtanding that herein conſiſteth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to my obiection) that it is happy that I can not ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we where it is forbidden: whereas euen in the very place that I bring here, when I ſhewe that almighty God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the ordinarie waye of reſoluing doubtes to be the ſentence of the highe prieſte, I ſhewe withall, that he forbadde alſo conference of ſcripture in ſuch wiſe as we he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re take conference, that is to be the finall and laſte reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of determining doubtefull controuerſies ariſing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the lettre. Excepte any man (you thincke) maye be ſo deſperate hardye, as when God hathe appointed one wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ye, to chooſe anye other as not forbidden. That whiche foloweth: But ſeing, &amp;c. is one of youre extraordinarye walckes, and perteineth not to my obiection, but yeat ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth well for youre purpoſe to giue vs the ſlippe, and to wynde youre ſelfe from the matter. To my demaunde what heretike was euer vanquiſhed by the ſcriptures, you ſaye:</p>
               <p>I anſwere, the Arrians, Anabaptiſtes: and all heretikes without <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 101. a. 5</note> exception were vanquiſhed and ouerthrowen by the ſcriptures: and that if they were not vanquiſhed by the ſcriptures, they were not vanquiſhed at all.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:17023:185"/>
               <p>By youre anſwere it ſhoulde ſeme M. Nowell, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> you vnderſtande not my demaunde, or you will not vnderſtande it. For when I ſpeake of vanquiſhing of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, I meane of ouerthrowing, and ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futing their here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, as that they maye with the worlde be brought vttrely oute of conceite, and the memorye of them cleane aboliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and extinguiſhed, as we ſee Arius hereſie (once more vniuerſall then youres) God be praiſed to be. I meane not you maye be ſure, that the heretikes them ſelues ſhoulde confeſſe them ſelues to be ouercomen. Againe, when I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke how they were vanquiſhed by the ſcriptures: I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, by the ſcriptures alone, by the ſcriptures withoute a iudge, who in this doubtefull contention (where the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian bringeth ſcripture as well as the catholike, as apparent as the catholike, more plentifully then the catholike: where no other place of ſcripture can by the catholike be brought to make the matter plaine by waye of conference, but the aduerſarie will be readie to alleage as euident for him) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ye giue ſentence whether parte hathe better right, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth and conferreth the ſcriptures moſte ſincerely. Thus did the councell of Nice ouerthrowe the hereſie of Arrius, although not ſo that he him ſelfe coulde be brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſo muche: yeat in ſuche wiſe that in proceſſe of time the worlde giuing credite to ſo learned and generall a councell, fell from his hereſie, and nowe there is not one fauourer thereof in the whole worlde that dare ſhewe his face. Thus ſhoulde youre hereſies and all other be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, if we woulde either in ſuche thinges as the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che hath already determined, folowe that ſenſe of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that it hathe deliuered to vs, either elles in thinges ambiguouſe and not defined, aſke and folowe the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therof.

Yeat do not the hiſtories mention that euer they were ſo impudent.</p>
               <p>Touching the conference of Scriptures together, I did ſo late <note place="margin">Nowell. b. 15.</note> before at large intreate thereof, that I nede not nowe to repeate the ſame againe.</p>
               <p>As largely M. Nowell as you intreated thereof, you ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> neuer a worde howe this controuerſie betwene the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and the catholikes bothe alleaging ſcripture for their <note place="margin">M. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth not the force of my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> defence, might be by onely ſcripture determined. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende therfore that it is no nede to repeate that which you neuer touched, it is a pretye figure to excuſe ſilence in that wherein you are able to ſaye nothing. Iff you feared you ſhoulde haue dwelled to longe in that matter, you might haue eaſed that by cutting of manye impertinent diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that bothe go before and folowe after in this booke off youres, namely the nexte ſentence that foloweth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein you labour to proue youre ſelues to be no Arrians, withe the whiche hereſye neither I, nor anye other doe charge yowe. To procede, whereas I aſke howe it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth that the Caluiniſtes and the Lutherans agree not by conferring one place of ſcripture with an other, to that you ſaye. <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 102. a. 23.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This is M. Dormans vſage, when he can ſaye nothing off the

               <p>The principall cauſe is, that there muſte be one viſible <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> heade in Chriſtes church to appeaſe controuerſies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine doubtes: the heretike ſaieth it nedeth not, the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture by diligent conference beinge able to ſatiſfie all men therein. To this I replied, how happeneth it then, that the Caluiniſtes and Lutheranes agree not &amp;c? Nowe lett all men iudge how truly yowe reprehende me for entremin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling foraigne matters. But let vs here youre anſwer to the queſtion.</p>
               <p>But how ſo euer Caluin and Luther agree in the expoſition of <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> theſe fewe wordes, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> This is my bodie, they agree bothe in this, that the papiſtes expounde them falſely.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:17023:187"/> is this I ſaie to the purpoſe? Anſwere if you be hable: if ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can alone ende all controuerſies, howe happeneth it that the Lutheranes and Caluiniſtes ende not theire ſtrife thereby, whiche continueth notwithſtanding their agreing againſt vs?

               <p>For to vſe the places by M. Dorman noted out of Hoſius, he, <note place="margin">Nowell. A. 26.</note> nor all papiſtes with him ſhall neuer be hable to ſhowe cauſe, why theſe wordes, <hi>Ego ſum vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As before I proued that the Arrians, Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſtes,

And as you anſwered before no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the obiections of the Arrians, Lutherans, and Caluiniſtes: ſo doe you here paſſe ouer in ſilence the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the Anabaptiſtes, and purge your ſelfe and youre companions, that yow be no Arrians, no Anabaptiſtes, withe <note place="margin">fo. 103. a. 8 M.

To the which (being but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des incidently caſt in) I marueile how anie man reading youre boke can forbeare laughing, to heare you ſlipping from the principall point, make this ſolemne anſwere to that which neded none at all.</p>
               <p>VVe anſwere: that it is moſte certeine and well knowen to the worlde, that oure men haue ſaide and written more againſt them then euer did the papiſts. VVherefore we be therein, as in all other thinges in deede, the Catholikes and not they.</p>
               <p>What ſo euer you haue written M.

But by the waye note I praie the that art the learned reader, a clerckly concluſion of M.

                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:17023:188"/> Arrians and Anabaptiſtes, was alltogether imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to my purpoſe. I haue proued the contrarie before: nowe let the learned reader iudge thereof. You charge me with declaiming againſt the ſcriptures and worde of God. That is a lye. You call it a ſeely ſimilitude and cruell likeliho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de <note place="margin">A lye. 79. Nowell. b. 12.</note> that I make betwene the Iuiſhe high prieſte and the pope.

You cal the pope and papiſtes heretikes, and their doctrine hereſies. You acknowledge him not to be the ſupreme heade or gouernour ouer all the churche. As long as you be not able to proue it, it maketh no matter, youre tongue is not autentike.</p>
               <p>Nowe where M.

Yea and he maye by the ſame reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> finde faulte withe Chriſte oure Sauiour and his holy apoſtles, who doe ſo muche vſe the ſame alleaging of ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>I go not about to proue the conference of ſcriptures a <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> vaine or euill thing, neither becauſe the Arrians and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes vſed it, neither for any other cauſe: you haue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beelied me once more. I acknowledge it to be bothe <note place="margin">A lye. 80.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:17023:189"/> proffitable and neceſſarie: only I ſaie, that to ende all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies it is an inſufficient meanes. Becauſe reiecting the determination of the churche, you take vpon you as the Arrians did and the Anabaptiſtes doe, to mainteine youre hereſies by this pretenſed conference of ſcripture, not regarding that ſuche iudgement belongeth to the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, therefore I call yow and iuſtly terme you heretikes. And as I doe reiect this conference that you talcke of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you vſe it to that ende that theſe heretikes did: ſo doe I refuſe all ſuche ſcripture toe as is falſely wreſted, as was that whiche the diuell alleaged. In whiche ſenſe becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Chriſte and his Apoſtles neuer alleaged anie, I can not finde faulte with them.</p>
               <p>I can not (you ſaye) deuiſe a waye that ſhoulde ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye <note place="margin">Nowell. a. 20.</note> all heretikes withoute all contradiction or exception on their parte.</p>
               <p>I can deuiſe no waie in dede M. Nowell to ſatiſfie al here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes: <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> it paſſeth my power I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe. But God hathe deuiſed a waye to ouerthrowe all hereſies, if ſuche as you are woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de <note place="margin">The way to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe hereſies.</note> be no let to his working. And that is the thinge that ought to ſuffice vs. Will you knowe what waye it is? Forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the if this principle and grounde the which I labour to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue, that Chriſtes churche here in earthe being but one and viſible, hathe alſo one chiefe viſible heade to rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the ſame, were thoroughly as it ought to be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all men, then the heretike which nowe by coloured argumentes triumpheth ouer, not onely the meaner ſorte but alſo oftentimes many of the wiſer and better learned, the thinge called into queſtion being either ſuche (as is the queſtion of baptiſing of infantes) as whereof we haue no expreſſe ſcripture, but onelye a tradition continued in the churche from the Apoſtles time, and deliuered from hande
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17023:189"/> to hande to vs, either elles ſo perplexe and doubteful, as the aduerſarie will for his hereſie bring not onely as many, but mo textes alſo, that ſhall ſeme to make for his purpoſe then ſhall the catholike, as did the Arrian: then ſhoulde I ſaye the heretike in al mens iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (although neuer in his owne) eaſely be diſcomfited and ouerthrowen. For then let the Anabaptiſte crie as muche as he woulde, that the baptiſme of infantes hathe no grounde of ſcripture, the meaneſt man in a pariſhe woulde be able to tell him: Sir, the churche whiche I am bidden to giue eare to by the ſcripture, vſeth it, and hathe done from the beginning, this ſuffiſeth me. Againe let the Arrian bringe and heape together all the ſcripture that he hathe, let him vſe all his ſhiftes, diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and gloſes: when he hathe all done, the true catholike ſeketh after the interpretation of the churche, that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation to witte, that the membres agreing with the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade obſerue and haue obſerued vniuerſally thoroughe out the whole worlde. Thus if the more parte of men woulde doe, (as they ought) neither woulde heretikes haue any liſt to publiſhe hereſies, their ſtarting holes being by this who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſome remedie taken awaye, neither ſhoulde they being brought furthe into the light be hable anie while to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue. And this call I the ouerthrowing of heretikes and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies. For to perſuade an indurat heretike by anye meanes, I confeſſe it to be a thing impoſsible: ſeing that not euerye man that is a true Chriſtian, can by conference of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture be by and by perſuaded in all doubtes, as you here vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly ſaye he maye. When partes be taken in opinions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt learned men, eache parte forcing the ſcriptures by conference and otherwiſe to make for that ſenſe which he hathe conceiued, is no man a true Chriſtian but he that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſatiſfied in this caſe by the ſcripture? Hath it not bene
<pb facs="tcp:17023:190"/> ſene that the mainteiners of ſuche contrary opinions, bein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge for vertue and learning eſtemed of the worlde, haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de alſo right good Chriſtians to doubte? And what caſe had Chriſte lefte vs in, if in this perplexitie there were not a churche to directe vs, if that churche had not a heade to ſpeake to vs, which being in S. Auguſtine and Proſpers ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me <note place="margin">

               <p>To youre concluſion, that the worde of God is the true <note place="margin">B. 13.</note> iudge in all controuerſies and doubtes of religion, I ſaie (as I ſaide before) that when the church hathe giuen ſentence of the meaning and right vnderſtanding of the ſcripture, that then in that ſenſe and no otherwiſe, the ſcripture is the true iudge in all controuerſies: otherwiſe I ſaie that the worde of God lieng yeat in the lettre as it were in the huſke, is an vncerteine iudge to determine controuerſies, what ſo euer Luther, Caluin or their adherentes, the reſt of that blacke garde do ſaye to the contrarie, or be M.

               <p>PROSEcuting this controuerſie, whether the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as we haue it written, were hable alone without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes to determine all controuerſies, the whiche the heretike ſeeth being proued that it can not, it will nedes folowe that there muſt be ſome other iudge to ſupplie that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:17023:191"/> office: I ſaide, that S. Hierome notwithſtanding his greate and excellent knowledge in the tongues, woulde not take vpon him to leane in the diſcuſsing of doubtes to that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le of theirs, to laie and confer together one texte with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but referred him ſelfe to the ſee of Rome &amp;c. whoſe example I exhorted alſo other to folowe. To this M. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well anſwereth as foloweth.</p>
               <p>S. Hierome ſaieth no where that he would enot compare the <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 106. a. 23.</note> ſcripture together for the diſcuſsing of doubtes (as M. Dorman woulde beare vs in hande) and S: Auſten ſaieth he woulde doe it, and exhorteth other to doe the ſame.</p>
               <p>Where doe I beare yowe in hande that <hi>S.</hi> Hierome <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> ſaide that he woulde not not compare the ſcriptures toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">A lye. 81<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> for the diſcuſsing of doubtes? Why noted you not here the leafe and ſide? I denie not but that it is a neceſſarie and verie proffitable waie of reading the ſcriptures to conferre the places together. And ſo doubte I not but that S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome aſwell as S. Auguſtine vſed to doe. The whiche maketh verye muche for the Catholique opinion, that all queſtions can not be diſcuſſed by thys conference off ſcripture. For iff they coulde, what neded S. Hierome (ſo well learned as he was) in this controuerſie betwene the Catholikes and the Arrians, to write ſo far out of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drenes of Syria to <hi>Damaſus</hi> the pope, a man allthough ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulerly well learned, yeat not comparable with him for lear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning, to be reſolued at his mouthe what parte to take, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas he had with him the ſcriptures of God, by the whiche (by youre ſaing) if he had diligently conferred them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he might haue bene fully inſtructed in al pointes? What ment he elles that he vſed not nowe his accuſtomed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of conference, but that he ſawe that this was a queſtion that coulde not ſo be tried, and therefore he woulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulte
<pb facs="tcp:17023:192"/> 
                  <hi>Damaſus,</hi> who being he perſuaded him ſelfe the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour of Peter, ſhoulde be able ſufficiently by the grace giuen to that office, to reſolue him in that, which by all his owne labour and diligence he were not at all, or not ſo ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and certeinly, hable to finde out.</p>
               <p>S. Hieromes wordes to Damaſus Biſhop of Rome make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> againſt vs, nor with M. Dorman. For what merueile is it, if that S. Hierome borne in a coaſt of Italy, chriſtened at Rome, brought vp at Rome, and made prieſte at Rome, woulde in the faithe of the bleſſed Trinitie, rather ioyne him ſelfe in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Damaſus biſhop of Rome a learned and godly ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then with Vitalis and Meletius (whome M. Dorman calleth Miletus) and Paulinus, who were Antiochia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> biſhoppes, and therfore ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers to him, and alſo not cleere from the Arrian hereſie?</p>
               <p>That you reporte of S. Hierome that he was borne in a <note place="margin">Dorman. The place of S.

                  </note> coaſt of Italie, it is vntrue. For he was as he writeth him ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, borne in a towne called <hi>Stridon</hi> in the borders of <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia</hi> and <hi>Pannonia:</hi> whereas Italie it is well knowen neuer reached ſo farre, or if it had, neuer did the peculier prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the biſhop of Rome extende thither, for whiche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Damaſus might be accounted his biſſhop. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this to be as true as the reſt, that he was Chriſtened at Rome &amp;c. Yeat the cauſes whiche S. Hierome addeth why he ioyned him ſelfe to him rather then to anie other, maie euidently make faithe, that neither becauſe he was borne in a coaſte of Italie, neither becauſe he was chriſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; brought vp, or made prieſte in Rome, but becauſe he was the ſucceſſour of Peter, he ioyned him ſelfe to hym in communion, rather then to anie other. For that ment he by theſe wordes <hi>Beatitudinituae, id eſt cathedrae Petri, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nione conſocior.</hi> To youre holineſſe, that is to ſaye, to Peters chaire, am I ioyned in communion. Tell vs if you can what there neded here anie mention of Peters chaire to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:17023:192"/> but that he woulde declare therby the only reſpect of his communicating with him to be, becauſe he was the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour of Peter. An other cauſe, which yeat might trulier be called a cauſe or reaſon of the firſt cauſe, why he ioyned him ſelfe to him that ſate in Peters chaire, your ſelfe woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de ſeme to haue founde out in theſe wordes folowing.</p>
               <p>But (will M. Dorman ſaye) S. Hierome addeth a cauſe (whiche is <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 107. a 10.</note> the pyth of the matter) ſaing thus. <hi>Super illam petram aedificatem eccleſiam ſcio. I knowe that vpon that rocke (Peters chaire) the churche is builded,</hi> which is the cauſe why S. Hierome ioyned with Damaſus, will he ſaye.</p>
               <p>Will you ſee what a perilouſe brained man M. Nowell is? <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> He hathe readen my anſwere allready, and can tell what it ſhallbe before I vtter it the ſeconde time. But you muſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue him leaue ſometimes to ſcoure his Rhetorike leſt it wax ruſtye, and therfore here vpon a brauery he ſetteth a luſty countenance vpon the matter, and that which he knoweth can not be paſſed ouer in ſilence, becauſe it hathe bene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued allready, he will ſo bring furthe the ſeconde time, as though ſuche a pore catholike as I am, had not had ſuche an obiection in ſtore, without I had firſt receiued it by his liberalitie euen as it were in the waye of all moiſe. Yeat this I can not but miſlike, that as ſone as he had giuen it, it ſemeth that he wiſhed that he had kepte it in his purſe ſtill, for it foloweth.</p>
               <p>But he maye be aſhamed, had he anie ſhame at all thus ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <note place="margin">Nowell. 14.</note> by a falſe Parentheſis to intremingle theſe wordes (Peters chaire) in this ſentence of S. Hierome, and ſo to falſifie it, as though S. Hierome had ſaide or ment in this place, that the popes chaire is the rocke whereon the church is builded.</p>
               <p>Well theſe be but wordes M. Nowell, how proue yow <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> that this is a falſe <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> that S. Hierome ment not that the popes chaire (as it is S. Peters chaire) is the rocke whereo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the churche is builded. Youre reaſons to proue it folowe
<pb facs="tcp:17023:193"/> after that you haue charged me withe mangling of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of S. Hierome, in this wiſe.</p>
               <p>For he did ſee, that S. Hierome admoniſhing Damaſus of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, <note place="margin">Nowell. b. 20.</note> and withall profeſsing him ſelfe to folowe no chiefe or heade but Chriſte, not excepting Damaſus caſe, but rather affirming him not to be <hi>primum,</hi> the chiefe, maketh cleerely with vs, who in this controuerſie of the popes vſurped ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſaie the ſame &amp;c. furthermore he did ſee, that the wordes of S. Hierome folowing <hi>(vpon this rocke I knowe the churche to be builded)</hi> might and ought to be referred to Chriſte mentioned <note place="margin">fol. 108. a. 1.</note> by S. Hierome ſo nere before, and by Petre confeſſed to be that rocke whereon the churche is builded, and therefore M. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man left out of S. Hieromes ſentence the mention of Chriſte, that he might moſte falſely and blaſphemouſly refer the rocke to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters chaire, as though Peters rotten chaire or ruinouſe Rome were the rocke whereon the churche of oure Sauioure Chriſte is builded.</p>
               <p>Youre proufes that this <hi>Parentheſis</hi> is falſe conteined <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> in theſe wordes, are two. Firſt becauſe Hierome profeſſed him ſelfe to folowe no chiefe or heade but Chriſte, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting <hi>Damaſus:</hi> nexte becauſe theſe wordes <hi>(Vpon this roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke I knowe the churche to be builded)</hi> ought to be referred to Chriſte &amp;c. as before. To the firſte I anſwere, that you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue <note place="margin">M. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well falſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fieth S. Hierome in tranſla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting.</note> not delt honeſtlie and ſincerely in tranſlating the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des <hi>nullum primum,</hi> no chiefe or heade: as though <hi>S.</hi> Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me had bene of that opinion, that he woulde profeſſe him ſelfe to folow no other heade in earthe vnder Chriſte, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che if it had bene ſo: howe agreeth this with youre owne <note place="margin">He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him ſelfe.</note> wordes in this place, that <hi>Damaſus</hi> was <hi>S.</hi> Hieromes owne biſhoppe? If he were his biſhop, he was his chiefe or heade. If he were his heade, you will not I truſt make him to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de youre owne cauſe, a rebelliouſe membre. One of theſe two will folowe, that either S. Hierome (if youre tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were true, condemneth all heades in earthe but onelye
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:17023:193"/> Chriſte, or that he will obeye them as far as he liſt him ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe. Is not this ſincere handling trowe you of the fathers writinges? Is not this wholeſom doctrine that you woulde make them to be patrones of? But I praie you that tranſlate this worde <hi>nullum primum,</hi> ſo diuerſly, three maner of waies in little more then the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of one leafe, firſt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, no chiefe or heade fol. 107. b. 5. lyne, then in the ſame ſide. 15. no chiefe heade, Laſt of all fol. 108. b. 21. no heade: tel vs when you write nexte, to whiche of theſe interpretations you will ſtande. For the ſecond interpretation a man might graunte to you, and without preiudice to vs or gaine to you. For it is true in dede that in reſpecte of Chriſt there is no abſolute chiefe heade but he: the pope is but chiefe and ſupreme heade nexte vnder Chriſte. Although this were not in this place the meaning of S. Hierome, but only to ſignifie, that nexte after Chriſte he ioyned him ſelfe to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters chaire, and that he folowed <hi>nullum primum niſi Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum,</hi> none firſt but Chriſt, as muche to ſaie, as Chriſt firſt, and Damaſus of all other next after.</p>
               <p>Youre nexte proufe that the worde <hi>(rocke)</hi> ſhoulde be referred to Chriſte and not to Peters chaire, becauſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte is mentioned ſo nere before, and by Petre confeſſed to be that rocke whereon the churche is builded, leaneth to a verie fickle and weake grounde, and maketh me to thinke, that at the leaſte you nodded M. Nowell if you ſlepte not downe right when you wrote this. For if you take the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke waking into youre hande once againe, you ſhall (I dare <note place="margin">M. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well ouer throwen by his owne reaſon.</note> aſſure you) finde, that the worde <hi>(Peters chaire)</hi> is nearer to the worde rocke then is Chriſte, ſo that by youre owne ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and reaſon it foloweth, that the worde <hi>(rocke)</hi> ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de be referred to Peters chaire placed ſo neare before. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas you ſaye that Petre confeſſed Chriſte to be that rocke
<pb facs="tcp:17023:194"/> whereon the churche is builded, where hathe Petre thoſe wordes? Note the place in youre nexte writing, elles will it be thought that you make and coine ſcripture at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. We denye not notwithſtanding but that Chriſte is the rocke whereon the churche is builded, although in Sainte Petre thoſe words be not ſo to be found. Yeat foloweth it not that therefore Peters chaire or Petre (for bothe is here taken for one) is not alſo the rocke whereon it is builded. For Chriſte is <hi>Fundamentum primum &amp; maximum,</hi> the chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efe and greateſt fundation (as witneſſeth S. Auguſtine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling together theſe places of the ſcripture, <hi>no man can</hi>

                  <hi>laye an other fundation then that which is layed which is Chriſte Ieſus,</hi> and this: <hi>Builded vpon the fundation of the Apoſtles and prophetes)</hi> and Petre is alſo a foundation, nexte after Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte. As to make the matter plaine by example: if a man woulde builde a houſe vpon a rocke, that rocke were the <note place="margin">How Chriſt is the rocke and howe Peter.</note> chiefe and principall foundation, for it hathe ſoliditie and ſtrength of it ſelfe not of an other, yeat all this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the firſte ſtone of this building that ſhoulde be laide vpon the rocke, were alſo the foundation, but not as hauing ſoliditie or ſtrength of it ſelfe, but of that other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect fundation whereunto it leaneth. To this alluded Saint Ambroſe when in a certeine place he calleth Petre <hi>firmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimam petra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the moſte ſtrong rocke, <hi>quae ab illa principali pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi>

                  <hi>communionem &amp; virtutis ſumſit &amp; nominis,</hi> which tooke from that principall rocke (he meaneth Chriſte) commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion bothe of vertue and name. What can be ſaide more plainely to expreſſe that Petre is called a rocke as well as Chriſte? to confirme this diſtinction of rockes or funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
               <p>Hauing nowe detected the vanitie of youre prouffes whereby you laboure to proue that this place of S. Hierom
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:17023:194"/> ſhoulde be falſified by me: I will confirme the catholike doctrine in this pointe, and ſhowe that this <hi>Parentheſis</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by me for the better vnderſtanding of the place, was trulie added. And becauſe yowe complaine of me for lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out two lynes, I will proue not onelie by them, but by the preamble of the epiſtle, that S. Hierome wrote not to <hi>Damaſus</hi> as to his owne biſhop, but to him as heade of the churche, and ſucceſſour to Petre.</p>
               <p>In the two lines that yow ſaie I cut of, are theſe wordes: <hi>cum ſucceſſore piſcatoris &amp; diſcipulo crucis loquor,</hi> with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour of the fiſſher (Peter) and a diſciple of the croſſe I ſpeake. Of theſe wordes I make this argument: S. Hierome wrote to Damaſus as to the ſucceſſor of S. Peter. But S. Petre was acknowledged by S. Hierome to be heade of the church, therefore S. Hierome wrote vnto him as heade of the churche. The <hi>minor</hi> propoſition is proued by S. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hieron. in Pſalm.</hi> 13.</note> Hierome writing vpon the 13. Pſalme, where expounding theſe wordes: <hi>Non eſt qui faciat bonum &amp;c. no</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>not Petre him ſelfe, which is heade of the churche.</hi> Againe in an other place where he ſaieth: <hi>Coenaculum grande eccleſia magna</hi>

                  <hi>there maie be one faithe vndre one ſhepeherd.</hi> The conſequent of this argument is proued to be good by this reaſon of <hi>S.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:17023:195"/> Hieromes, why God appointed S. Petre to be the ruler of the churche. For ſeing we muſte nowe aſwell auoide mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of faithe as the churche was bounde in S. Petres ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to doe, there muſt as neceſſarilie be nowe one heade as there was then, whiche no man can iuſtly doubte whether <hi>S.</hi> Hierome ment that <hi>Damaſus</hi> ſhoulde be, ſeing he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that <hi>Damaſus</hi> is Petres ſucceſſour, who was by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion that one heade. And that it maie the better appeare that this was in <hi>S.</hi> Hieromes time the faithe of the church, that as Petre was heade therof ſo were alſo his ſucceſſours: S. Ambroſe liuing with S. Hierome, calleth this verie <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus</hi> ruler of gods houſe the churche, whome I woulde <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In</hi> 1. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth.</hi> 3.</note> not alleage but trie out S. Hieromes meaning by him ſelfe, were it not that yow might ſee how vniformely they agree in this point, Hierome calling Petre the maiſter: Ambroſe calling <hi>Damaſus</hi> his ſucceſſour, the ruler of goddes houſe the churche. Moreouer, that in calling Peter heade of the churche and <hi>Damaſus</hi> his ſucceſſour, S. Hierome called <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus</hi> alſo heade of the churche, is proued by this, that S. Hierome in this place proteſting that he was ioyned to <hi>Damaſus</hi> in communion, expoundeth him ſelfe, <hi>id eſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrae Petri,</hi> that is to ſaie to the chaire of Petre. Thus did S. Cyprian in his time deſcribing the biſhoprike of Rome by theſe wordes <hi>Locus Fabiani,</hi> Fabians place, expounde by and by his meaning in this wiſe: <hi>id eſt locus Petri, &amp; gradus cathedrae ſacerdotalis,</hi> that is to ſaie, Petres place and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 2.</note> of the prieſtely chaire. If therefore the popes that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede S. Peter haue the ſame place, the ſame chaire, that is to ſaie the ſame auctoritie (for this worde chaire ſignifieth no thing elles) that <hi>S.</hi> Petre had: who doubteth but that S. Hierom in this place acknowledging him ſelfe to ſpeake to Petres ſucceſſour, did agniſe alſo the ſame auctorite in him,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17023:195"/> that he did in S. Petre?</p>
               <p>Next after this, weigh I beſeche yow the preamble of this epiſtle of S. Hierome to Damaſus, vttred in theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. <hi>Quoniam vetuſto Oriens inter ſe populorum furore colliſus. &amp;c. Becauſe the Eaſte being ſore brooſed and ſhaken with the ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de furie of the people emongeſt them ſelues, teareth pece meale the whole and ſeameleſſe coate of oure Lorde, and the foxes deſtroye Chriſtes vineiarde, ſo that emongeſt the leaking pittes that haue no water, it is harde to vnderſtande where is that ſealed founteine and walled gardein: therefore I thought that Petres chaire and</hi>

                  <hi>the faithe praiſed by the Apoſtles owne mouthe, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted by me, from thence nowe aſking foode for my ſoule, from whence once I receiued Chriſtes lyuory.</hi> Thus far S. Hierome. By which wordes we maie vnderſtande, that he wrote this epiſtle to <hi>Damaſus,</hi> as to him that being ſucceſſour to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre was heade of the churche, and therefore in all doubte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full caſes to be conſulted, not as to his owne proprebiſhop. For if he had, why ſhoulde he then haue mentioned Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres chaire, which worde becauſe <hi>S.</hi> Peter was heade of the whole churche (as hath bene proued out of <hi>S.</hi> Hierome) ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth a rule ouer the whole, not of a particuler place alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne? If nowe <hi>S.</hi> Hierome were not afearde to ſaie, that he ioyned him ſelfe in communion to Petres chaire, that in this doubtefull caſe he thought that that chaire was to be conſulted, why take yowe the matter ſo whotly againſt me, for ſaing with S. Hierome that the churche is builded vpon Petres chaire? Why call you this more blaſphemie then the other, to be ioyned in communion to Petres chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, to conſult Petres chaire? Is it vnlikely that S. Hierome ſhoulde ſaie that Petres chaire was the rocke whereon the churche was builded, to the whiche chaire he ſought for councel, to the which he proteſted to be ioyned in the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:17023:196"/> communion? Or is it likely, that he woulde haue ſo ſaide of anie chaire, ſaue that on the which the churche was buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? I can not here but note by the waie how to make the matter ſeme odiouſe to the vnlearned, you vſe termes like youre ſelfe againſt this chaire of S.

But in that place Chriſte appointed an other fundation of the church beſide him ſelfe to wit Peter: It foloweth therefore that S.

Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is more then probable, that ſainte Hierome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not in this place of building the churche vpon Chriſte only, but vpon Petre alſo nexte after Chriſte, becauſe to him that with iudgement wil reade the epiſtle, conſidre duly the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunſtances, eſpecially the beginning, it ſhal appeare that his whole talcke is ſo framed, that whereas of purpoſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly he maketh mention of conſulting Peters chaire, off ioyning him ſelfe to Peters chaire, and in that whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of his ſetteth furthe the praiſes of the churche off Rome: he ſpeaketh of Chriſte but incidently, and as it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re by the waie of a <hi>parentheſis,</hi> and that toe, to auaunce the dignitye of the See of Rome, as before the which he woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de preferre (he ſaide) none but Chriſte.

Laſt of all, it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to be iudged, that S. Hierome agreeth here with his owne writinges in other places. Nowe is this euident, that euen the thirde epiſtle before thys, he ſaieth in plaine wordes that the churche was builded vppon Petre. His wordes

It foloweth that I ſhowe to you howe he proſecuteth his purpoſed malice by the auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Eraſmus, and S. Auguſtine, in the 108. 109. and 110. leaues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eraſmus</hi> (ſaieth M.

Non ſuper Romam vt arbitror, &amp;c.</hi> That is to ſaie. Vpon that rocke, not vpon Rome I trowe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From Eraſmus thus farre we diſſent not, that we knowe <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> as well as he, that the church was not built vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome. For if Rome were ſacked (as God forbid) to morowe nexte, the church ſhould continue neuertheleſſe, although the biſhop went from thence and ſhoulde ſit at the meaneſt towne in all Italye, or elles where. As for that that he woulde haue the churche to be builded by S. Hieromes meaning vppon Peters faithe: that firſt he affirmeth not confidently, but ſaieth he troweth ſo: next, it maye be ſaide, that in this place Eraſmus telleth his owne opinion: in the other place off this epiſtle vpon theſe wordes <hi>Extra hanc domum</hi> without this houſe, he confeſſeth the minde of S. Hierome, whiche he ſaieth was vtterly <hi>that all churches ought to be vndre the Romaine See, or no ſtrangers from it.</hi> If Eraſmus in his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation before, ſaing that the churche was not as he thought builded vpon Rome, but vpon the faith of Petre, agree with S. Hierome in this pointe that all churches be ſubiect to the Romaine See: howe happeneth it that you
<pb facs="tcp:17023:198"/> and youre fellowes, to withdrawe all men from this ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to that See, make that principle that the churche was builded not vpon Rome but vpon Petres his faithe, you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re chiefe grounde, ſeing that in Eraſmus iudgement bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the might ſtande well inoughe together? Iff on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye parte this interpretation made by Eraſmus can not agree with the minde of Saint Hierome: Why ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de we rather credite Eraſmus not ſure off his owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, then <hi>S.</hi> Hierome confidently affirming the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye?</p>
               <p>Yea and furder the ſame Eraſmus in the beginning of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Nowell. fol. 108. b. 1.</note> vpon his treatye againſt the Luciferians, whiche is nexte to his two epiſtles to Damaſus, hathe theſe wordes: <hi>Nulla haereſis gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius afflixit, &amp;c.</hi> No hereſie hathe more grieuouſly afflicted the chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches of all the worlde, then the Arrians: in ſo muche that it hathe wrapped in the biſhoppes of Rome, and the emperours them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. It pleaſeth M. Dorman ſometime to alleage Eraſmus againſt vs, whoſe auctoritye if it be good, downe goeth the pope and all popery. For if the biſhoppes of Rome haue bene infected with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, then is not there that vniuerſall rocke.</p>
               <p>As good men as Eraſmus and better to haue ſuſtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> the contrary, that there was neuer biſhoppe of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me heretike. But if there had, it foloweth not thereof, that there is not that vniuerſall rocke. Let that be the anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re till I come to youre queſtion, What if the Pope be an heretike?</p>
               <p>Nowe if M. Dorman did not ſee theſe notes of Eraſmus vpon <note place="margin">Nowell. b. 16.</note> the place by him alleaged out of S.

But I thinke euen for that cauſe a little thinge woulde make yow to call S.

               <p>As for youre other witneſſes that you can ioyne to Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, that popes haue bene heretikes, if that could be proued <note place="margin">A. 24.</note> by a hundred witneſſes, yeat till you be hable to proue that they had erred in defining anye matter iudicially, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the ſame to the whole churche of Chriſte, yowe haue proued nothing againſt this See that there is not the rocke.</p>

               <p>Is not this M.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17023:201"/> the omitting whereof in my boke, I deſerued rather to be noted at the catholikes handes of ouermuche ſimplicitye, then at youres of fraude and ſutteltye? But howe truly he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re let the place itſelfe iudge. Omitting Eraſmus whoſe iudgement nowe you condemne (which yeat in me might haue bene counted ſome pointe of leuitie, if I had euer pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed him as you did before, to be no vnſkillfull or negligent viewer of the olde fathers writinges) I will come to the place it ſelfe, whiche I doubte not but by conſtruing (for I truſte although you care not muche for the rules of the churche you owe yeat for olde acquaintaunce youre reuerence to the rules of Grammer) to make bothe you and other men to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d alſo how much this place maketh for me, and howe little cauſe I had to ſuppreſſe it, and howe muche yet leſſe you had to make anye mention of it.

If you can conſtrue them otherwiſe, and make them to haue any other relation then this and proue it by the rulers of Gramer, you maye vaunt that you haue ſhowed vs a ſcholemaſters tricke that neuer was harde of yeat. But I am halfe in diſpare that you ſhall euer be able, ſeing that youre frinde Eraſmus as good a Grammarian as you, and as euill in a maner affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the See of Rome, as appeareth in diuerſe places by his notes and cenſures, coulde finde no ſuche ſhifte, and therefore was faine as you muſte at the length, to confeſſe the truthe, that S. Hierome was of the minde that all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſhoulde be ſubiecte to the churche of Rome, or at the leaſt no ſtrangers from it. Nowe whereas you ſaye that this houſe that S.

               <p>I reporte me to the learned, whether I had cauſe to ſaie <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> ſo or no, not becauſe of theſe wordes <hi>(who ſo euer gathereth not with the ſcattreth)</hi> alone, which might perhappes be trulie ſpoken to anie other catholike biſhop: but becauſe of the circumſtances that go before ioyned to theſe, as the conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Petres chaire, the ioyning of him ſelfe thereto in communion. To the whiche becauſe they did not ioyne them ſelues as he did, he refuſed them. If yow had ſpoken no more vntrulie then I, yowe woulde not to colour the matter the better, haue imagined, that emongeſt other cauſes why S. Hierome kepte not theſe ſchiſmatikes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, one was, becauſe they were foriners and not his owne biſhoppes: an other, for that they were of a ſtrange language. Ah M.

You can not

                  </gap>es, ſo doe I nowe anſwere you againe. But you will ſaie, that I am the auctor of this compariſon my ſelfe, who reaſon, that the churche muſt haue one hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, becauſe kingdomes, countries, cities, be ſo beſt gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. It is my reaſon (I confeſſe) that euery thing that is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne is beſt gouerned by one. And therefore the worlde it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, were for vs that liue in the ſame beſt gouerned by one chiefe heade vnder Chriſte, if for the paine of oure ſinnes God had not diſpoſed the ſame to be gouerned by manie. Which when yow ſaie to be a thing impoſsible bothe in the church and in the world, you ſpeake as you are wont with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie proufe, muche to the derogation of goddes om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency. Nowe to come to youre compariſon: ſee I praie yow whether if God had appointed all the kingdomes in the worlde to be one, as he hathe all the churches to be one (for he came into the worlde, <hi>vt diſperſos congregaret in v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.</note> to gather the diſperſed together) it ſhoulde not be alſo a deade troncke if it lacked a viſible heade to make it one. Your ſimilitude betwene the churche and oure common wealthe, is made betwene Chriſte heade of the churche on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, a multitude of miniſtres gouernours of the ſame vndre him, and the common wealthe hauing God the heade in heauen, and one prince, his ſeruaunt and heade gouernour
<pb facs="tcp:17023:207"/> in earthe. This compariſon maketh not onelye not withe yow, but verie muche alſo againſt yow. Firſt it maketh not with yow, becauſe yow ſuppoſing the churche to be one bodie and Chriſte the onelye heade thereof, allowe to the churche manie vndreheades, whereas in the common wealthe being allſo one bodye and the other parte of the compariſon, there is mention but of one heade vndre Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte, the prince him ſelfe. So that thereupon to infer, that the churche hauing an infinite no more of heades beinge but one bodye, is no monſtre, becauſe the common wealth hauing but one viſible heade like to it ſelfe is no monſtre: it is a monſtrouſe concluſion, more meete to procede from a blocke that hathe no ſenſe, or a monſtre that hathe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye heades but wit in none of them, then from a creature endowed with reaſon. It maketh againſt yowe thus: the common wealth where be manie heades and euerie one will gouerne, is a monſtrouſe bodye: but the churche is Chriſtes common wealthe, and hathe as yowe ſaie, manie heades to gouerne it: therfore it is a monſtre. Againe: The common wealthe that becauſe Chriſte is the onelye heade thereof in heauen will admit no other chiefe heade in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the, is a blocke. But ſo doeth youre churche: therefore it is a blocke or deade troncke.</p>
               <p>As for the concluſions that yowe ſaie I maie make, that God and Chriſte be no heades or no ſuche heades, &amp;c. and againe, that aſwell all kingdomes, and common weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes in Chriſtendom be liue monſtres as hauing many heades &amp;c. In dede I muſte nedes confeſſe a truthe, God hathe giuen me free will, and I maie abuſe it if I liſt, and make as manye fooliſhe concluſions as yow haue done. But I truſt yowe will not deale with me as yow ruffled before with the pore Franciſcanes and thoſe of the company of Ieſus, to conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:17023:207"/> that I will ſaie ſo becauſe I maie ſaie ſo if I liſt to plaie the foole. Nowe to theſe concluſions I ſaie, that trulie I can not ſo conclude, the firſt of them folowing no better, then if yow M. Nowell woulde conclude, that God and Chriſte the auctors of all true doctrine can not inſtructe men (if it ſo pleaſed them) in all wholeſome knowledge without the externall helpe of man, becauſe they doe this by men. For euen as God vſeth the miniſtery of men to teache and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache, not as though he coulde not ſo doe without, for our infirmities ſake, and becauſe it pleaſed the diuine wiſdome that Chriſte the ſeconde perſone in Trinitie ſhould not be allwaies viſibly preſent with vs: for the ſame cauſe hathe it pleaſed all mightie God, to gouerne the membres of his churche, by the meanes of one viſible heade the B. of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. The folie of youre ſeconde concluſion appeareth I doubte not, by the difference that is betwene all the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the world, which make all but one, and the kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes which be diuerſe and were neuer appointed to be one.</p>
               <p>And had M. Dorman had ſo muche leaſure from his diuinitie <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> matters, as to haue looked better vpon his notes of the canon la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we, his peculier ſtudie, he woulde haue bene better aduiſed then to haue called vs <hi>Acephalos</hi> headleſſe, and therefore deade trunckes, who doe obeie oure owne prelates, ſeing <hi>Acephali</hi> (as is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) are thoſe who be ſubiecte to no prelate.</p>
               <p>And had M. Nowell had ſo muche witte to haue loked <note place="margin">Dorman</note> firſt vpon the texte and then vpon the gloſe from whence he borowed this note, he woulde haue bene better aduiſed then to haue alleaged it of all other for their defence. For by the texte it appeareth, that thoſe whome the gloſe there cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Acephali,</hi> had heades, <hi>quos miniſtros ſeu cuſtodes vel gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianos aut nominibus alijs appellant,</hi> whome they cal miniſtres, kepars, wardens or by other names. Why dothe the gloſe
<pb facs="tcp:17023:208"/> then call then headleſſe? <hi>quia ſub nullius veri praelati obedientia exiſtunt,</hi> becauſe they are vnder the obedience of no true prelate. This is the reaſon of the gloſe. But yeat let vs aſke an other queſtion: why were they vnder the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of no true prelate? Becauſe their heades were not alowed by the pope. This is the reaſon of the texte. You muſt not be angry with me M. Nowel for charging you as I doe with the cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law. For you bogge me in my peculier ſtudie (as you ſaie), and you ſeme to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued greate truſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this place, which maketh me the bolder and earneſter to. With the texte and the gloſe agreeth reaſon: for if your head that ſtandeth now vpon your ſhoulders, ſhould ſodenly be turned in to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of an Aſſe, he ſhould not ſaye amiſſe that for all the long eares, ſhoulde ſaye you were headleſſe, not for that that yow had no heade at all ſuche a one as it were, but in this reſpect that you had no ſuche heade as you ſhoulde haue, no ſuche heade as a preacher ſhoulde loke out of a pulpite withal. To come nowe nearer to the common caſe of you all, and to exemplifie it by ſome of youre lignage that haue gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you: were the ſubiectes of Nouatus trowe you that falſe biſhop, <hi>Acephali</hi> without a heade, when forſaking <hi>Cornelius</hi> the B. of Rome, they obeied him? If they were, you are. For youre caſe is like, your biſhoppes being no more truly biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes then Nouatus was, nor alltogether ſo truly neither. For he was made biſhop by two biſhoppes laufully made by the pope, whereas you were made by the commiſsion, <hi>curre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant &amp; ego non mittebam.</hi> Nowe ſeing the canon lawe helpeth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hier. cap.</hi> 23.</note> you not, yea ſeing it maketh directly againſt you, as the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che accounteth them headleſſe that appointe heades to them ſelfe without the popes approbation, ſeing at the lawes of the realme you finde as I heare ſaie as little grace: ſeing that by the ſcriptures you are condemned for running not being

               <p>All this a doe hathe M.

               <p>Not to deface the ſcripture M.

The places that you bring out of the canon lawe, to proue that it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the pope to ſaye without reaſon of ſcripture why he ſo ſaieth, are two: but in neither of thoſe places is that which you ſaye. The firſt place ſpeaketh of certeine priuile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which the pope for cauſes and conſiderations will not haue extendid to monaſteries and churches after a certeine time. Here ſaieth the gloſe vpon this place, that the popes will in this caſe ſtandeth for reaſon.

But whereas in truthe there is but one laufull pope, it is in no ſuche daunger as yow fantaſy, not if there were ten that pretended euery of them right to the papacy. If any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che chaunce happen, we knowe it chaunceth by Goddes permiſsion, who as he hath hetherto ſo guided his chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, that when the like hathe happened, it neuer ſuſtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereby anie detriment in faithe: ſo are we by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe aſſured who promiſed neuer to forſake his churche, that he will in no wiſe permitte in this doubtefull time anye ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie to be moued, as that maye not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute the detriment of his church, remaine in ſuſpenſe vntil ſuche time as God haue reuealed the right iudge and true pope.</p>
               <p>What if there be neuer a pope at all? Shall all oure doubtes lye <note place="margin">Nowell. b. 25.</note> therewhile vndiſcuſſed for lacke of a iudge, and youre popiſhe church ſo longe (two or three yeares together) lye as a dead tronc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> for lacke of an heade?</p>
               <p>If your doubtes be ſuche as the vſage of the churche, the <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> conſent of all nations, be not able to explicate, then is there no other remedie but by praier to deſire allmightye God, to kepe from vs no longre this neceſſarie meane ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him in earthe to ſignifie to vs his holye will and pleaſure.

For euen as there (although not in all thinges) the Chapitre ſupplieth the lacke of the biſhop in many: ſo the See of Rome being voide by deathe, hathe a graue Senate, that ſupplieth, althoughe not in defining of controuerſies, yeat in manie thinges, that want of the heade. I truſt when the generall heade of the church of England in earthe dieth, you will not call your church a deade troncke.</p>
               <p>VVhat if the pope ſitte not at Rome in Italie? May we not doubt <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> of the certeintie of the iudge, not ſitting in the chaire whereof he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> hath all his certeintie?</p>
               <p>The pope hathe not his certeintie of Peters materiall <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> chaire, but of the auctoritie and power giuen to Petre, the ſigne whereof the chaire is. And therefore you nede not to trouble youre ſelfe with that care: whether he ſitte in the verye ſame chaire that Petre did or in ſome other, whether he ſit at Auinion in Fraunce, or Toletum in Spaine, he is allwaies biſhoppe of Rome, and ſucceſſour to Petre. And as we ſaie, where the kinge is there is the courte: ſo where the pope ſitteth there is Peters chaire, to ſaye Petres aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye.</p>

               <p>The pope maye haue his priuate and perſonall errours, <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> it can not be denied.

The firſt auctors that put that wicked deuiſe in to the kinges moſte noble heade, were not the catholikes but heretikes, and the ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of Luther, ſuche as were Cromwell, Cranmere, and other.

               <p>Yow burden verie ſore the readers memorie to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> that which hetherto yowe neuer vttred. Yow are not wont to be ſo daungerouſe (I reporte me to the reader) to repeate one thing diuerſe times, but there was good cauſe that yow ſhoulde here doe as yow did, to wit, becauſe yow are not hable (ſtanding in ſtrength the argument of you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Apologie) to giue anie reaſon, why the churche of one particuler realme, hauing two prouinces, two archebiſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, and vndre them aboue 20. biſhoppes, whereof Chriſte is as muche the heade as of the whole churche, ſhoulde more haue an other heade beſide Chriſt ouer all theſe particuler heades, then all the particuler heades of Chriſtes vniuerſall churche ſhoulde haue an other heade beſide Chriſte ouer them. Yeat I knowe yowe meane that reaſon of youres, whiche being ſo fooliſhe, ſo wicked and blaſphemouſe, that one man is not hable to rule and gouerne (vndre Chriſte) the whole churche alone, yow haue ſo often repeated, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no other ſhift of deſcant, that euen verie ſhame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth yow now at the laſt, to wrappe and inuolue it in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. As for the anſwere that yowe make by a queſtion: VVhy one kingdome maye haue in earth vnder God one head, and the whole world can not: to that I ſaie, that it is a falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that the whole worlde can not haue one onlye head in earth vndre God, often in this youre Reproufe ſtoutely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, but neuer as yeat proued. To this anſwere I ioyne alſo the ſeconde, that the queſtions be not like. But then you ſaye:</p>
               <p>If M. Dorman ſaye the queſtions be not like, I aſke with what <note place="margin">Nowell. b. 1.</note> face he can ſo ſaye, ſeing that in the beginning of this his treatie, he brought the example of ciuile gouernement, in the whiche euery

               <p>I acknowledge this example, and dare further make <note place="margin">Dorman.</note> you M.

I compare one kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to the whole church which is alſo one, and therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the ſtrength and force of my exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple: I make no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon betwene all kingdomes of the worlde whiche be manie, and all churches which are but one, as you doe here deceauing your ſelfe and other toe. For if I ſhoulde ſo haue done, then had not the compariſon bene good. Nowe if it were as true that God had ordeined all the kingdomes of the worlde to make one kingdome and not manie, as he hath all the churches to be one and not manie: then if you denied to all theſe kingdomes ioyned in one, a viſible king to be aboue all the reſt, and to gouerne the whole, becauſe god is the Monarche and ruler of all, as you doe to the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall churche for the ſame cauſe: I woulde ſaie that you offendid as muche therein, not alowing to all theſe kingdomes being but one, one heade and chiefe gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as you ſhoulde doe if you woulde graunte to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer kingdomes no particuler king: the reaſon being as greate why the whole ſhoulde haue one ruler ouer it, as why anie particuler membre ſhoulde. But nowe I can not ſo ſaye, becauſe God hath appointed no ſuche ordre in the worlde, as he hath in his kingdome the churche, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the queſtions be not like.</p>
               <p>From this you runne as one that feared to tarie to long, to geſſe what we woulde ſaie if the time ſerued vs, and here on Gods name you tel vs a long tale of the popes rule ouer all the worlde in temporalities, and of king Iohn, as muche

You haue ſeene that of S.

               <p>VVherefore you maye well vnderſtande that were it either <note place="margin">Nowell.</note> proffitable or neceſſary &amp;c to haue ſuch an one heade, God woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de haue certified vs of a thing ſo proffitable and neceſſarie, more plainely and exproſſely then by two olde ſhadowes of the Iuiſhe churche, which doe teache vs alſo the contrary.</p>

But what meane yow to finde faulte with the teſtimonies of the olde teſtament, calling them ſhadowes, and to demaunde other of the newe, hauing brought for youre opinion not ſo muche as one piece of a ſentence, out of either the olde teſtament or the newe?</p>
               <p>Yow ſee howe blindely he going aboute to proue that there <note place="margin">Nowell. fo. 120. a. 1</note> ought to be one onelye heade ouer all the church, bringeth in for proufe thereof the regiment of ſeuerall countries, kingdomes, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp;c. by ſeuerall princes, ſeuerall magiſtrates and heades, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che maketh moſte directly with vs, that ſeuerall churches, ſhould in likewiſe haue their ſeuerall heades.</p>

Baſile brought to declare the maner off heretikes in contemning the auctoritie of their biſhoppes, he laieth to my charge vntruly, to haue bene brought as ſpoken of the pope of Rome. Yow ſee that the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon made betwene Nouatus and oure proteſtantes of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland holdeth in this, that either of them laboureth to withdrawe the ſubiectes from their laufull obedience. Yow haue heard good Readers the ſory melodie of M. Nowelles harpe, whereupon twanging on a falſe ſtring he made a ſhamefull lye, in ſaing that <hi>Vrſitius</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> offred vp their recantation as well to Athanaſius as to Iulius the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe. Yow ſee that he hath oftentimes beelied. S. Cyprian and S. Hierome, feining them to make all biſhoppes equall in auctoritie, and no one to be aboue the other. Yowe ſee his owne inconſtancie and diſagrement withe him ſelfe, one while affirming all biſhoppes to be equall and none to be aboue the other, an other while denieng, and making chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe prelates in euerie prouince: yow ſee him reiecting pope Leo as witneſſe in his owne cauſe, and bringing in the African to esbeare witneſſe to them ſelues.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:17023:215"/>
               <p>Yow ſee to deface pope Leo howe ſhamefully he ſcla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undreth Zoſimus, of whome the whole Africane councell wrote ſo reuerently. Yow ſee howe he burdeneth without all maner of proufe, <hi>Celeſtinus</hi> (of whome Proſper writeth ſo honorably) with other his ſucceſſours, to haue forged a greate many of the epiſtles nowe abrode in the names of <hi>Clement,</hi> Anacletus &amp;c. yowe ſee howe he ſpareth no iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſe wordes to Leo calling him theefe, noting him of ambition whome the councell of Calcedon called thriſe bleſſed, and God honoured withe miracles. Yow ſee that he chalengeth vntrulie the copies of Leo to be contrarye one to an other. Yow ſee that he is a plaine makebate, and to mende his cauſe by ſetting the doctours at variance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene them ſelues, how he heweth, mangleth, and cutteth awaie from the auctors that he alleageth, wordes, yea ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to ſerue his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>You ſee in defence of ſchiſmes howe he laboureth to finde vnquietneſſe emongeſt the Apoſtles and diſciples of Chriſte: you ſee that to deface vnitie, as he taketh it from the Apoſtles, ſo he attributeth it to the Phariſeis and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſte. You ſee for lacke of weightier matter he chargeth vs with the diſputable opinions of ſcholemen and logiciners, with diuerſitie of apparell, of diete and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, which maners as you haue hearde, were yeat emongeſt the religiouſe in the primitiue church.</p>
               <p>You ſee how often he repeateth and neuer proueth, that it is impoſsible for one man to gouerne the whole churche. You ſee that Nazianzenes wordes were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged by me as ſpoken of one pope, and that therfore therein as in manie other thinges he hathe alſo beelied me.</p>
               <p>You ſee the wordes of an auncient auctor printed with
<pb facs="tcp:17023:216"/> S. Auſten, and of long time taken for him alleaged: why not as boldely M. Nowel as you without bluſſhing alleage a worcke by the title of being printed withe Chriſoſtome, and of long time taken for him?</p>
               <p>And vniuerſally you ſee M. Nowelles falſehode in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, or fraude in corrupting, mangling, or adding to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che auctors as he dothe alleage: you ſee his lyes as thicke as leaues. You ſee my ſelfe diſcharged of ſuche falſe tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, corrupting, mangling, as here vntruly he reproueth me of. 5. tymes in the margent. Neither is his deceite and <note place="margin">fol. 120. b. 30.</note> guile comparable to his impudency, as being not abaſſhed to alleage the epiſtle of the African councell ſent to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtinus, for the proufe of a decree pretended to be made in the councell againſt appealing from thence to Rome, and ſending legates from Rome thither, whereas there is no ſuche decree ſpecified there. And thus you ſee good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, while M. Nowell in this long Reproufe of his, hathe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> anſwered nothing to the ſcripture alleaged but moſte vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely and fondly this, that God hathe prouided better for his churche then for the Synagoge by apointing ouer it many heades, where as the Synagoge had but one, and alſo that the Iues were but one nation &amp;c. which anſweres ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed before: while the argument taken from S. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Cyprian and S. Hierom concluding that ſeing ſchiſmes be raiſed by not obeing the particuler heades of euery dioceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, that then by greater reaſon ſchiſmes are like to growe in the vniuerſall church, if emongeſt ſo manie heades there be not one chiefe heade to rule the reſt, is not yeat ſoluted: while the reaſon that euerie ſeuerall companie that is one, ought to haue a ſeuerall heade to rule the ſame, applied to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the churche, hath not hetherto bene anſwered, the only reaſon that M.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17023:216"/> impoſsible for one man to gouerne the whole churche <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> being directed by the ſpirite of God (for otherwiſe we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it not) neuer being proued: it foloweth, that my prouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes by the ſcripture, by the mindes of the auncient fathers, by good and probable reaſon, ſtande vpright againſt youre wrangling Reproufe M.

               <p>For M.

Be we therefore ſo crookened
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:17023:220"/> withe flattrye, that we ſhoulde forget the prieſtly right, and that whiche God gaue to me I ſhoulde thinke to be to be commited to other? If the biſhop be to be taught of the Laye man, what will folowe? Let the laye man then diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te and the biſhoppe be a hearer: let the biſhoppe learne off the laye man. But truly if we will loke to the courſe of the <note place="margin">Note.</note> holy ſcripture, or call to memorye the times paſt, who can denye that in a cauſe of faithe, a matter I ſaie of faithe, the biſhoppes were wont to iudge of Chriſtian. Emperours, not Emperours of biſhoppes. Yow ſhall be God willing youre ſelfe one daye of more ripe age, and then you ſhall iudge what maner of biſhoppe he is, whiche bringeth the right of prieſthode in ſubiection to lay men. Thus farre the wordes of Sainte Ambroſe to Valentinian the Emperoure, taking vpon him by euell councell to entremedle in eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall iuriſdiction. When to theſe places I added the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table teſtimonies out of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> where the Emperour <note place="margin">In epiſt. ad Solitar. vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tam agent.</note> is bidden <hi>not to entremedle nor commaunde in eccleſiaſticall matters:</hi> He is <hi>called Antichriſte for making him ſelfe chiefe of the biſhoppes, for ruling in eccleſiaſticall iudgementes, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his palace the conſiſtory of eccleſiaſticall matters:</hi> Finally when I brought Caluin him ſelfe againſt this opinion of making temporall princes the heades in eccleſiaſticall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, did I fight with mine owne ſhadowe? Did I laboure in confuting that whiche no man holdeth? Are not theſe auctorities directly againſt the commaunding of princes in eccleſiaſticall thinges, againſt the taking vpon them to correcte or iudge biſhoppes in matters of faithe, wherein the office M. Nowell ſaieth of the heade dothe conſiſte? You maye therefore nowe perceiue good Readers that it was but a pretended cauſe of M. Nowelles parte that he here alleageth, to ſhift of that to M.
